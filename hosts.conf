# The Gigablast host configuration file.
# Tells us what hosts are participating in the distributed search engine.


# How many mirrors do you want? If this is 0 then your data
# will NOT be replicated. If it is 1 then each host listed
# below will have one host that mirrors it, thereby decreasing
# total index capacity, but increasing redundancy. If this is
# 1 then the first half of hosts will be replicated by the
# second half of the hosts listed below.

num-mirrors: 0



# List of hosts. Limited to 512 from MAX_HOSTS in Hostdb.h. Increase that
# if you want more.
#
# Format:
#
# first   column: hostID (starts at 0 and increments from there)
# second  column: the port used by the client DNS algorithms
# third   column: port that HTTPS listens on
# fourth  column: port that HTTP  listens on
# fifth   column: port that udp server listens on
# sixth   column: IP address or hostname that has an IP address in /etc/hosts
# seventh column: like sixth column but for secondary ethernet port. (optional)


# This file consists of a list of lines like this:
#
# <ClientDnsPort> <HttpsPort> <HttpPort> <UdpPort> <IP1> <IP2> <Path>
#
# By default just use the local host as the single host as listed below.
#
# The client DNS uses port 5998, https listens on 7000, http listens on port
# 8000 and the udp server listens on port 9000. We used to use port 6000 for
# DNS listening but it seemed to have some issues. If your DNS keeps timing
# out try a different port from 5998.
#
# If your server only has one IP then just repeat it as IP1 and IP2. You
# can also use an alphanumeric name from /etc/hosts in place of a direct
# IP address. (see example below)
#
# Use './gb N' to run the gb process as host #N where N is 0 to run as
# the first host in the list below. 
#
# Use './gb start N' to use passwordless ssh to ssh to that Nth machine
# listed below and start the process. Use must have private/public keys
# for the required passwordless ssh.
#
# Use './gb kstart N' to run the Nth host in a bash keep-alive loop. So if it
# cores it will restart. It will send out an email alert if it restarts.
#
# The working directory is the last string on each line. That is where the
# 'gb' binary resides.
#

#
# Example of a four-node distributed search index running on a single
# server with four cores. The working directories are /home/mwells/hostN/.
# The 'gb' binary resides in the working directories. We have to use
# different ports for each gb instance since they are all on the same
# server.
#
# Use './gb 2' to run as the host on IP 1.2.3.8 for example.

#
# Example of an eight-node cluster.
# Each line represents a single gb process with dual ethernet ports
# whose IP addresses are in /etc/hosts under se0, se0b, se1, se1b, ...

# Proxies
# Proxies handle the incoming search request and load balance it to 
# one of the hosts listed above. If you only have one host in your search
# engine then you probably do not really need the proxy. You need to make
# sure all shard hosts and all proxies have the same hosts.conf because
# they ping each other to ensure they are up.
#
# To start a proxy you can run './gb proxy load 0' to start the first
# proxy in your list. Use './gb proxy load 1' to start the second proxy, etc.
#
# Use './gb proxy start N' to start the Nth proxy, where N starts at 0,
# mentioned in the proxy list below. You need to enable passwordless ssh
# using private/public keys for that to work. 
#
# Use './gb proxy kstart N' to start the Nth proxy in a keep-alive loop using
# the bash shell. So if it cores it will restart and send you an email alert.
#
# Format:
# First  column is "proxy" and followed by the standard columns described above
#
# Example:
# A proxy will be running on 10.5.66.18:
#proxy 6001 7001 8001 9001 10.5.66.18
