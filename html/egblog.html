Today I launched my new page design. I took lots of feed back from very giving individuals and used it to make things prettier and easier to use. Also I amped up the recommendation engine. So please take it out for a spin and see if it recommends events that are interesting.

<font size=+1><b>Interactive Widget Now Available</b></font><br>
<i>Apr 4, 2012</i><br><br>
The Event Guru widget can now be made interactive. Just click the "Interactive Widget" checkbox in the "Widget" menu. Here's what it looks like: <a href=http://www.eventguru.com/?widgetmenu=1&showwidget=1&interactive=1>interactive widget</a>.

I added a nice little gadget or widget for your <a href=http://www.igoogle.com/>iGoogle</a> homepage. It has a built-in mini-gui so you can customize your event search experience within the iGoogle framework. <a href="http://fusion.google.com/add?source=atgs&moduleurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhosting.gmodules.com%2Fig%2Fgadgets%2Ffile%2F108415847701685077985%2Feventguru.xml%3Fnocache=1">Add the event gadget / widget to iGoogle</a>. 
A bigger screenshot is on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/78679723@N05/7045569795/in/photostream">Flickr</a>. 
You can also add it to your <a href=http://sites.google.com/>Google Site</a> by clicking on the "Insert" menu and selecting "More Gadgets". You might have to manually enter the URL because it might not be visible in the gadget search directory yet: <a href="http://hosting.gmodules.com/ig/gadgets/file/108415847701685077985/eventguru.xml">right click and copy this url</a>. 
And you can see the <a href=https://sites.google.com/site/eventwidget/>event widget on Google Sites</a> as an example.

<font size=+1><b>New Layout and Personalized Event Recommendations</b></font><br>

Now Event Guru generates events "<a href=/?showpersonal=1>Just for You</a>". Tailored to YOUR interests. It can also email you these events on a regular basis. For it to work the best, you need to login to Facebook. Event Guru now also has color-coded constraint bars that appear atop the search results. That way you don't get confused as to what you're looking at. And its also now able to easily invite your friends and get driving directions to an event. To do that, just click on the event in the search results and then click the appropriate icon on the following page. New documentation on the event widget <a href=/widget.html>here</a> or <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1DMRho-kjlh9cWpZyTfD4Js-rQxI9A1VGYetk27eCmG4">here</a>.

Too many changes to list here, so you'll just have to <a href=/>see for yourself</a>!

<font size=+1><b>International Events</b></font><br>
<i>Mar 20, 2012</i><br><br>
Just added better international and location support. Event Guru will ask for your current latitude and longitude. And you can now enter in any city or country in the location search box. This makes a lot of sense as we build up our collection of outside-the-U.S. events.

<font size=+1><b>Documentation</b></font><br>
<i>Mar 18, 2012</i><br><br>
Added the <a href=/api.html>Developer API</a>, a new <a href=/help.html>Help</a> page for explaining query syntax, as well as a more intricate <a href=/bio.html>Bio Timeline</a> for myself.

<font size=+1><b>Facebook Support</b></font><br>
<i>Feb 28, 2012</i><br><br>
Facebook support is now integrated. In addition to changing the domain name from Flurbit.com to EventGuru.com, we also sport a new logo. The collection of events is absolutely huge now. I probably have double or triple all the other event sites <b>combined</b>.

<font size=+1><b>First Update</b></font><br>
<i>Jan 31, 2012</i><br><br>
We are now the biggest collection of events in the U.S. As expected, the competition's manual system was no match for Flurbit's crawler's speed. Now I need to improve the website.

Just launched Flurbit. The web design still needs improvement and probably need to change the name. It is not quite the largest event search engine in the U.S. but it is close and gaining. Being the only automated crawler I expect it to be the biggest soon.
