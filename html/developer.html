<hr><h1>Getting Started</h1>

Welcome to Gigablast. Thanks for supporting this open source software.

<a name="ssh"></a>
<br><br>
<h2>SSH - A Brief Introduction</h2>
Gigablast uses SSH extensively to administer and develop its software.  SSH is a secure shell
connection that helps protect sensitive information over an insecure network.  Internally, we 
access our development machines with SSH, but being prompted
for a password when logging in between machines can become tiresome as well as development gb
processes will not execute unless you can ssh without a password.  This is where our authorized
keys file comes in.  In your user directory you have a .ssh directory and inside of that directory
there lies an authorized_keys and known_hosts file.  Now what we first have to do is generate a 
key for your user on the current machine you are on.  Remember to press &lt;Enter&gt; when asked for a 
passphrase, otherwise you will still have to login.<br>
<code><i> ssh-keygen -t dsa </i></code><br>
Now that should have generated an id_dsa.pub and an id_dsa file.  Since you now have a key, we need to
let all of our trusted hosts know that key.  Luckily ssh provides a simple way to copy your key into 
the appropriate files.  When you perform this command the machine will ask you to login.<br>
<code><i> ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub destHost</i></code><br>
Perform this operation to all of our development machines by replacing destHost with the appropriate
machine name.  Once you have done this, try sshing into each machine.  You should no longer be 
prompted for a password. If you were requested to enter a password/phrase, go through this section again, 
but DO NOT ENTER A PASSPHRASE when ssh-keygen requests one. <b>NOTE:  Make sure to copy the id to the 
same machine you generated the key on.  This is important for running gigablast since it requires to ssh 
freely.</b>
<br>
<br>
<i>Host Key Has Changed and Now I Can Not Access the Machine</i><br>
This is easily remedied.  If a machine happens to crash and the OS needs to be replaced for whatever
reason, the SSH host key for that machine will change, but your known_hosts file will still have the
old host key.  This is to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, but when we know this is a rebuilt machine
we can simply correct the problem.  Just open the ~/.ssh/known_hosts file with your favorite editor.  
Find the line with the name or ip address of the offending machine and delete the entire line (the 
known_hosts file separates host keys be newlines).<br>
<br><br>

<a name="shell"></a>
<hr><h1>Using the Shell</h1>
<!-- I'd like to nominate to remove a majority of this section - if you need help with bash at this point, you probably
   	shouldn't be poking around in the code... Maybe just keep the dsh and export command descriptions? SCC -->
Everyone uses the bash shell. The navigation keystrokes work in emacs, too. Here are the common commands:
<br><br>

<table cellpadding=3 border=1>
<tr><td>Command</td><td>Description</td></tr>
<tr><td><nobr>export LD_PATH=/home/mwells/dynamicslibs/</nobr></td><td>Export the LD_PATH variable, used to tell the OS where to look for dynamic libraries.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ctrl+p</td><td>Show the previously executed command.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ctrl+n</td><td>Show the next executed command.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ctrl+f</td><td>Move cursor forward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ctrl+b</td><td>Move cursor backward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ctrl+a</td><td>Move cursor to start of line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ctrl+e</td><td>Move cursor to end of line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ctrl+k</td><td>Cut buffer from cursor forward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ctrl+y</td><td>Yank (paste) buffer at cursor location.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ctrl+Shift+-</td><td>Undo last keystrokes.</td></tr>

<a name="git"></a>
<hr><h1>Using Git</h1>

Git is what we use to do source code control. Git allows us to have many engineers making changes to a common set of files. The basic commands are the following:<br><br>
<table border=1 cellpadding=3>
<tr>
<td><nobr>git clone &lt;srcdir&gt; &lt;destDit&gt;</nobr></td>
<td>This will copy the git repository to the destination directory.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<br/>
<h3>Setting up GitHub on a Linux Box</h3>
To make things easier, you can set up github access via ssh. Here's a quick list of commands to run:
(assuming Ubuntu/Debian)
<pre>
sudo apt-get install git-core git-doc
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
git config --global color.ui true
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your@email.com" -f ~/.ssh/git_rsa
cat ~/.ssh/git_rsa.pub
</pre>
Copy and paste the ssh-rsa output from the above command into your Github profile's list of SSH Keys.
<pre>
ssh-add ~/.ssh/git_rsa
</pre>
If that gives you an error about inability to connect to ssh agent, run:
<pre>
eval `ssh-agent -a`
</pre>
Then test and clone!
<pre>
ssh -T git@github.com
git clone git@github.com:gigablast/open-source-search-engine
</pre>
<br><br>

<a name="hardware"></a>
<hr><h1>Hardware Administration</h1>

<h2>Hardware Failures</h2>
If a machine has a bunch of I/O errors in the log or the gb process is at a standstill, login and type "dmesg" to see the kernel's ring buffer. The error that means the hard drive is fried is something like this:<br>
<pre>
mwells@gf36:/a$ dmesg | tail -3
scsi5: ERROR on channel 0, id 0, lun 0, CDB: Read (10) 00 13 89 68 82 00 00 18 00 
Info fld=0x1389688b, Current sd08:34: sense key Medium Error
 I/O error: dev 08:34, sector 323627528
</pre>
If you do a <i>cat /proc/scsi/scsi</i> you can see what type of hard drives are in the server:<br>
<pre>
mwells@gf36:/a$ cat /proc/scsi/scsi 
Attached devices: 
Host: scsi2 Channel: 00 Id: 00 Lun: 00

</pre>
<!-- Should most of the following be kept internally at GB? Not sure it would help with open-source users... SCC -->
So for this error we should replace the <b>rightmost</b> hard drive with a spare hard drive. Usually we have spare hard drives floating around. You will know by looking at colo.html where all the equipment is stored.
<br><br>
If a drive is not showing up in /proc/scsi/scsi when it should be, it may be a bad sata channel on the motherboard, but sometimes you can see it again if you reboot a few times. 
<br><br>
Often, if a motherboard failures, or a machine just stops responding to pings and cannot be revived, we designate it as a junk machine and replace its good hard drives with bad ones from other machines. Then we just need to fix the junk machine.
<br><br>
At some point we email John Wang from TwinMicro, or Nick from ACME Micro to fix/RMA the gb/g/gf machines and gk machines respectively. We have to make sure there are plenty of spares to deal with spikes in the hardware failure rate.
<br><br>
Sometimes you can not ssh to a machine but you can rsh to it. This is usually because the a drive is bad and ssh can not access some files it needs to log you in. And sometimes you can ping a machine but cannot rsh or ssh to it, for the same reason. Recently we had some problems with some machines not coming back up after reboot, that was due to a flaky 48-port NetGear switch.
<br><br>
<h2>Replacing a Hard Drive</h2>
When a hard drive goes bad, make sure it is labelled as such so we don't end up reusing it. If it is the leftmost drive slot (drive #0) then the OS will need to be reinstalled using a boot cd. Otherwise, we can just <b>umount /dev/md0</b> as root and rebuild ext2 using the command in /home/mwells/gbsetup2, <b>mke2fs -b4096 -m0 -N20000 -R stride=32 /dev/md0</b>. And to test the hard drives thoroughly, after the mke2fs, <i>nohup badblocks -b4096 -p0 -c10000 -s -w -o/home/mwells/badblocks /dev/md0 >& /home/mwells/bbout </i>. Sometimes you might even need to rebuild the software raid with <b>mkraid -c /etc/raidtab --really-force /dev/md0</b> before you do that. Once the raid is repaired, mount /dev/md0 and copy over the data from its twin to it. On the newly repaired host use <b>nohup rcp -r gbXX:/a/* /a/ &</b> where gbXX is its twin that has all the data still. DO NOT ERASE THE TWIN'S DATA. You will also have to do <b>rcp -r gbXX:/a/.antiword /a/</b> because rcp does not pick that directory up.
<br><br>
<h2>Measuring Drive Performance</h2>
Slow drives are sometimes worse than broken drives. Run <b>./gb thrutest &lt;directoryToWriteTo&gt; 10000000000</b> to make gigablast write out 10GB of files and then read from them. This is also a good test for checking a drive for errors. Each drive should have a write speed of about 39MB/s for a HITACHI, so the whole raid should be doing 150MB/s write, and close to 200MB/s for reading. Fuller drives will not do so well because of fragmentation. If the performance is less than what it should, then try mounting each drive individually and seeing what speed you get to isolate the culprit. Sometimes you can have the drive re-seated (just pulling it out and plugging it back in) and that does the trick. A soft reboot does not seem to work. I don't know if a power cycle works yet or not.
<br><br>
<h2>Measuring Memory Performance</h2>
Run <b>membustest 50000000 50</b> to read 50MB from main memory 50 times to see how fast the memory bus is. It should be at least 2000MB/sec, and 2500MB/sec for the faster servers. Partap also wrote <b>gb memtest</b> to see the maximum amount of memory that can be allocated, in addition to testing memory bus speeds. The max memory that can be allocated seems to be about 3GB on our 2.4.31 kernel.
<br><br>
<h2>Measuring Network Performance</h2>
Use <b>thunder 50000000</b> on the server with ip address a.b.c.d and <b>thunder 50000000 a.b.c.d</b> on the client to see how fast the client can read UDP packets from the server. Gigablast needs about a Gigabit between all machines, and they must all be on a Gigabit switch. Sometimes the 5013CM-T resets the Gigabit to 100Mbps and causes Gigablast to basically come to a hault. You can detect that by doing a <b>dmesg | grep e1000 | tail -1</b> on each machine to see what speed its network interface is running at.
<br><br>

<a name="kernels"></a>
<hr><h1>Kernels</h1>
Gigablast runs well on the Linux 2.4.31 kernel which resides in /gb/kernels/2.4.31/. The .config file is in that directory and named <b>dotconfig</b>. It does have the marvel patch, mvsata340_2.4.patch.bz2 applied so Linux can see the Marvel chip that drives the 4 sata devices on our SuperMicro 5013CM-T 1U servers. In addition we comment out the 3 'offline' statements in drives/scsi/scsi_error.c in the kernel source, and raised the 3 TIMEOUT to 30. These changes allow the kernel to deal with the 'drive offlined' messages that the Hitachi drives SCSI interface give every now and then. We still set the 'ghost lun' think in the kernel source to 10, but I am not sure if this actually helps, though.
<br><br>
Older kernels had problems with unncessary swapping and also with crashing, most likely due to the e1000 driver, which drives the 5013CM-T's Gigabit ethernet functionality. All issues seem to be worked out at this point, so any kernel crash is likely due to a hardware failure, like bad memory, or disk.
<br><br>
I would like to have larger block sizes on the ext2fs filesystem, because 4KB is just not good for fragmentation purposes. We use mostly huge files on our partitions, raid-0'ed across 4 400GB Sata drives, so it would help if we could use a block size of a few Megabytes even. I've contacted Theodore T'so, the guy he wrote e2fs, and he may do it for a decent chunk of cash.
<br><br>



<a name="coding"></a>
<hr><h1>Coding Conventions</h1>

When editing the source please do not wrap lines passed 80 columns. Also, 
please make an effort to avoid excessive nesting, it makes for hard-to-read 
code and can almost always be avoided.
<br><br>
Classes and files are almost exclusively named using Capitalized letters for
the beginning of each word, like MyClass.cpp. Global variables start with g_,
static variables start with s_ and member variables start with m_. In order
to save vertical space and make things more readable, left curly brackets ({'s)
are always placed on the same line as the class, function or loop declaration.
In pointer declations, the * sticks to the variable name, not the type as
in void *ptr.  All variables are to be named in camel case as in lowerCamelCase.
Underscores in variable names are forbidden, with the exception of the g_, s_ and m_ prefixes, of course.  
<br><br>
And try to avoid lots of nested curly brackets. Usually you do not have to nest
more than 3 levels deep if you write the code correctly.
<br><br>
Using the *p, p++ and p < pend mechanisms is generally preferred to using the 
p[i], i++ and i < n mechanisms. So stick to that whenever possible.
<br><br>
Using ?'s in the code, like a = b ? d : e; is also forbidden because it is too cryptic and easy to mess up.
<br><br>
Upon error, g_errno is set and the conditions causing the error are logged.
Whenever possible, Gigablast should recover after error and continue running 
gracefully.
<br><br>
Gigablast uses many non-blocking functions that return false if they block,
or true if they do not block. These type of functions will often set the 
g_errno global error variable on error. These type of functions almost always
take a pointer to the callback function and the callback state as arguments.
The callback function will be called upon completion of the function.
<br><br>
Gigablast no longer uses Xavier Leroy's pthread library (LinuxThreads) because
it was buggy. Instead, the Linux clone() system call is used. That function
is pretty much exclusively Linux, and was the basis for pthreads anyway. It
uses an older version of libc which does not contain thread support for the
errno variable, so, like the old pthreads library, Gigablast's Threads.cpp 
class has implemented the _errno_location() function to work around that. This
function provides a pointer to a separate thread's (process's) own errno 
location so we do not contend for the same errno.
<br><br>
We also make an effort to avoid deep subroutine calls. Having to trace the
IP stack down several functions is time-consuming and should be avoided.
<br><br>
Gigablast also tries to make a consistent distinction between size and length. 
Length usually refers to a string length (like strlen()) and does not include 
the NULL terminator, if any. Size is the overall size of a data blob, 
and includes everything.
<br><br>
When making comments please do not insert the "//" at the very first character
of the line in the first column of the screen.  It should be indented just
like any other line.
<br><br>
Whenver possible, please mimice the currently used styles and conventions 
and please avoid using third party libraries. Even the standard template 
library has serious performance/scalability issues and should be avoided.
<br><br>

<a name="debug"></a>
<hr><h1>Debugging Gigablast</h1>

<h2>General Procedure</h2>
When Gigablast cores you generally want to use gdb to look at the core and see where it happened. You can use BitKeeper's <b>bk revtool &lt;filename&gt;</b> to see if the class or file that cored was recently edited. You may be looking at a bug that was already fixed and only need to update to the latest version.

<h2>Using GDB</h2>

<p>We generally use gdb to debug Gigablast. If you are running gb, the gigablast process, under gdb, and it receives a signal, gdb will break and you have to tell it to ignore the signal from now now by typing <b>handle SIG39 nostop noprint</b> for signal 39, at least, and then continue execution by typing 'c' and enter. When debugging a core on a customer's machine you might have to copy your versino of gdb over to it, if they don't have one installed.</p>

<p>There is also a /gb/bin/gdbserver that you can use to debug a remote gb process, although no one really uses this except Partap used it a few times. </p>

<p>The most common way to use gdb is:
<ul>
<li><b>gdb ./gb</b> to start up gdb.
<li><b>run -c ./hosts.conf 0</b> to run gb under gdb.
<li><b>Ctrl-C</b> to break gb
<li><b>where</b> to make gdb print out the ip stack
<li><b>break MyClass.cpp:123</b> to break gb at line 123 in MyClass.cpp.
<li><b>print &lt;variableName&gt;</b> to print out the value of a variable.
<li><b>watch &lt;variableName&gt;</b> to set a watchpoint so gdb breaks if the variable changes value.
<li><b>set &lt;variableName&gt; &lt;value&gt;</b> to set the value of a variable.
<li><b>set print elements 100000</b> to tell gdb to print out the first 100000 bytes when printing strings, as opposed to limiting it to the default 200 or so bytes. 
</ul>
</p>

<p>You can also use gdb to do <i>poor man's profiling</i> by repeatedly attaching gdb to the gb pid like <b>gdb ./gb &lt;pid&gt;</b> and seeing where it is spending its time. This is a fairly effective random sampling technique.</p>

<p>If a gb process goes into an infinite loop you can get it to save its in-memory data by attaching gdb to its pid and typing <b>print mainShutdown(1)</b> which will tell gdb to run that function which will save all gb's data to disk so you don't end up losing data.</p>

<p>To debug a core type <b>gdb ./gb &lt;coreFilename&gt;</b> Then you can examine why gb core dumped. Please copy the gb binary and move the core to another filename if you want to preserve the core for another engineer to look at. You need to use the exact gb that produced the core in order to analyze it properly.
</p>

<p>It is useful to have the following .gdbinit file in your home directory:
<pre>
set print elements 100000
handle SIG32 nostop noprint
handle SIG35 nostop noprint
handle SIG39 nostop noprint
set overload-resolution off
</pre>
The overload-resolution gets in the way when tring to print the return value of some functions, like uccDebug() for instance.
</p>

<h2>Using Git to Help Debug</h2>
<a href="#git">Git</a> can be a useful debugging aid. By doing <b>git log</b> You can see what the latest changes made to gb were. This may allow you to isolate the bug. <b>bk diff HEAD~1 HEAD~0</b> will actually list the files that were changed from the last commit, instead of just the changesets. Substituting '1' with '2' will show the changes from the last two commits, etc.

<h2>Memory Leaks</h2>
All memory allocations, malloc, calloc, realloc and new, go through Gigablast's Mem.cpp class. That class has a hash table of pointers to any outstanding allocated memory, including the size of the allocation. When Gigablast allocates memory it will allocate a little more than requested so it can pad the memory with special bytes, called magic characters, that are verified when the memory is freed to see if the buffer was overwritten or underwritten. In addition to doing these boundary checks, Gigablast will also print out all the unfreed memory at exit. This allows you to detect memory leaks. The only way we can leak memory without detection now is if it is leaked in a third party library which Gigablast links to. 

<h2>Random Memory Writes</h2>
This is the hardest problem to track down. Where did that random memory write come from? Usually, RdbTree.cpp, uses the most memory, so if the write happens it will corrupt the tree. To fight this you can turn <i>protect</i> the RdbTree by forcing RdbTree::m_useProtection to true in RdbTree::set(). This will make Gigablast protect the memory when not being accessed explicitly by RdbTree.cpp code. It does this by calling mprotect(), which can slow things down quite a bit.

<h2>Corrupted Data In Memory</h2>
Try to reproduce it under gdb immediately before the corruption occurs, then set a watchpoint on some memory that was getting corrupted.  Try to determine the start of the corruption in memory. This may lead you to a buffer that was overflowing. Often times, a gb process will core in RdbTree.cpp which never happens unless the machine has bad RAM. Bad RAM also causes gb to go into an infinite loop in Msg3.cpp's RdbMap logic. In these cases try replacing the memory or using another machine.

<h2>Common Core Dumps</h2>
<table>
<tr><td>Problem</td><td>Cause</td></tr>
<tr><td>Core in RdbTree</td><td>Probably bad ram</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>Common Coding Mistakes</h2>
<table>
<tr><td>1.</td><td>Calling atoip() twice or more in the same printf() statement. atoip() outputs into a single static buffer and can not be shared this way.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2.</td><td>Not calling class constructors and destructors when mallocing/freeing class objects.  Need to allow class to initialize properly after allocation and free any allocated memory before it is freed.</td></tr>

<hr><h1>Code Overview</h1>
Gigablast consists of about 500,000 lines of C++ source. The latest gb version being developed as of this writing is /gb/datil/. Gigablast is a single executable, gb, that contains all the functionality needed to run a search engine. Gigablast attempts to uniformly distribute every function amongst all hosts in the network. Please see <a href="overview.html">overview.html</a> to get a general overview of the search engine from a USER perspective.
<br><br>
Matt started writing Gigablast in 2000, with the intention of making it the most efficient search engine in the world. A lot of attention was paid to making every piece of the code fast and scalable, while still readable. In July, 2013, the majority of the search engine source code was open sourced. Gigablast continues to develop and expand the software, as well as offers consulting services for companies wishing to run their own search engine.
<br><br>
<hr>

<a name="loop"></a>
<h1>The Control Loop Layer</h1>
Gigablast uses a <b>signal-based</b> architecture, as opposed to a thread-based architecture. At the heart of the Gigablast process is the I/O control loop, contained in the <a href="../latest/src/Loop.cpp">Loop.cpp</a> file. Gigablast sits in an idle state until it receives a signal on a file or socket descriptor, or a "thread" exits and sends a signal to be cleaned up. Threads are only used when necessary, which is currently for performing disk I/O, intersecting long lists of docIds to generate search results (which can block the CPU for a while) and merging database data from multiple files into a single list.
<br><br>
<a href="#threads">Threads</a> are not only hard to debug, but can make everything more latent. If you have 10 requests coming in, each one requiring 1 second of CPU time, if you thread them all it will take 10 seconds until each query can be satisfied and the results returned, but if you handle them FIFO (one at a time) then the first request is satisfied in 1 second, the second in two seconds, etc. The Threads.cpp class handles the use of threads and uses the Linux clone() call. Xavier Leroy's pthreads were found to be too buggy at the time.
<br><br>
Loop.cpp also allows other classes to call its registerCallback() function which takes a file or socket descriptor and when call a given callback when data is ready for reading or writing on that file descriptor. Gigablast accomplishes this with Linux's fcntl() call which you can use to tell the kernel to connect a particular file descriptor to a signal. The heart of gb is really sigtimedwait() which sits there idle waiting for signals. When one arrives it breaks out and the callback responsible for the associated file descriptor is called.
<br><br>
In the event that the queue of ready file descriptors is full, the kernel will deliver a SIGIO to the gb process, which performs a poll over all the registered file descriptors.
<br><br>
Gigablast will also catch other signals, like segmentation faults and HUP signals and save the data to disk before exiting. That way we do not lose data because of a core dump or an accidental HUP signal.
<br><br>
Using a signal based architecture means that we have to work with callbacks a lot. Everything is triggered by an <i>event</i> similar to GUIs, but our events are not mouse related, but disk and network. This naturally leads to the concept of a callback, which is a function to be called when a task is completed.
So you might call a function like <b>readData ( myCallback , myState , readbuf , bytesToRead )</b> and gigablast will perform the requested read operation and call <b>myCallback ( myState )</b> when it is done. This means you have to worry about state, whereas, in a thread-based architecture you do not.
<br><br>
Furthermore, all callbacks must be expressed as pointers to <b>C</b> functions, not C++ functions. So we call these C functions wrapper functions and have them immediately call their C++ counterparts. You'll see these wrapper functions clearly illustrated throughout the code.
<br><br>
Gigablast also has support for asynchronous signals. You can tell the kernel to deliver you an asynchronous signal in an I/O event, and that signal, also known as an interrupt, will interrupt whatever the CPU is doing and call gb's signal handler, sigHandlerRT(). Be careful, you cannot allocate memory when in a real-time/asynchronous signal handler. You should only call function names ending in _ass, which stands for asychronous-signal safe. The global instance of the UdpServer called g_udpServer2 is based on these asynchronous signals, mostly set up for doing fast pings without having to worry about what the CPU is doing at the time, but it really does not interrupt like it should most likely due to kernel issues. It doesn't seem any faster than the non-asynchronouys UDP server, g_udpServer.
<br><br>This signal-based architecture also makes a lot of functions return false if they block, meaning they never completed because they have to wait on I/O, or return true and set g_errno on error. So if a function returns false on you, generally, you should return false, too.
<br><br>
The Loop class is primarily responsible for calling callbacks when an event
occurs on a file/socket descriptor. Loop.cpp also calls callbacks that
registered with it from calling registerSleepCallback(). Those sleep callbacks
are called every X milliseconds, or more than X milliseconds if load is 
extreme.  Loop also responds to SIGCHLD signals which are called when a thread
exits. The only socket descriptor related callbacks are for TcpServer and
for UdpServer. UdpServer and TcpServer each have their own routine for calling
callbacks for an associated socket descriptor. But when the system is under
heavy load we must be careful with what callbacks we call. We should call the
highest priority (lowest niceness) callbacks before calling any of the 
lowest priority (highest niceness) callbacks. 
To solve this problem we require that every callback registered with Loop.cpp
return after 2 ms or more have elapsed if possible. If they still need to
be called by Loop.cpp to do more work they should return true at that time,
otherwise they should return false. We do this in order to give higher priority
callbacks a chance to be called. This is similar to the low latency patch in
the Linux kernel. Actually, low priority callbacks will try to break out after 
2 ms or more, but high priority callbacks will not. Loop::doPoll() just calls
low priority 



<a name="database"></a>
<hr><h1>The Database Layer</h2>
Gigablast has the following databases which each contain an instance of the 
Rdb class: 
<pre>
Indexdb     - Used to hold the index.
Datedb      - Like indexdb, but its scores are dates.
Titledb     - Used to hold cached web pages.
Spiderdb    - Used to hold urls sorted by their scheduled time to be spidered.
Checksumdb  - Used for preventing spidering of duplicate pages.
Sitedb      - Used for classifying webpages. Maps webpages to rulesets.
Clusterdb   - Used to hold the site hash, family filter bit, language id of a document.
Catdb       - Used to classify a document using DMOZ.
</pre>

<a name="rdb"></a>
<h2>Rdb</h2>
<b>Rdb.cpp</b> is a record-based database. Each record has a key, and optional 
blob of data and an optional long (4 bytes) that holds the size of the blob of 
data. If present, the size of the blob is specified right after the key. The 
key is 12 bytes and of type key_t, as defined in the types.h file.

<h3>Adding a Record to Rdb</h3>
<a name="rdbtree"></a>
When a record is added to an Rdb it is housed in a binary tree, 
<b>RdbTree.cpp</b>,
whose size is configurable via gb.conf. For example, &lt;indexdbMaxTreeSize&gt;
specified how much memory in bytes that the tree for Indexdb can use. When the 
tree is 90% full it is dumped to a file on disk. The records are dumped in 
order of their keys. When enough files have accrued on disk, a merge is 
performed to keep the number of files down and responsiveness up. 
<br><br>
Each file, called a BigFile and defined by BigFile.h, can actually consist of 
multiple physical files, each limited in size to 512MB. In this manner 
Gigablast overcomes the 2GB file limit imposed by some kernels or disk systems.
Each physical file in a BigFile, after the first file, has a ".partX" 
extension added to its filename, where X ranges from 1 to infinity. Throughout
this document, "BigFile" is used interchangably with "file".
<br><br>
If the tree can not accomodate a record add, it will return an ETRYAGAIN error.
Typically, most Gigablast routines will wait one second before retrying the
add.
<br>

<h3>Dumping an Rdb Tree</h3>
The RdbDump class is responsible for dumping the RdbTree class to disk. It
dumps a little bit of the tree at a time because it can take a few hundred
milliseconds seconds to gather a large list of records from the tree, 
especially when the records are dataless (just keys). Since RdbTree::getList() 
is not threaded it is important that RdbDump gets a little bit at a time so 
it does not block other operations.
<br>

<a name="mergingfiles"></a>
<a name="rdbmerge"></a>
<h3>Merging Rdb Files</h3>
Rdb merges just enough files as to keep the number of files at or below the 
threshold specified in gb.conf, which is &lt;indexdbMaxFilesToMerge&gt; for 
Indexdb, for example. <b>RdbMerge.cpp</b> is used to control the merge logic. 
The merge chooses which files to merge so as to minimize 
the amount of disk writing for the long term. It is important to keep the 
number of files low, because any time a key range of records is requested, the
number of disk seeks will be low and the database will be responsive.
<br><br>
When too many files have accumulated on disk, the database will enter "urgent 
merge mode". It will show this in the log when it happens. When that happens, 
Gigablast will not dump the corresponding RdbTree to disk because
it will create too many files.  If the RdbTree is full then any
attempts to add data to it when Gigablast is in "urgent merge mode" will fail
with an ETRYAGAIN error. These error replies are counted on a per host basis
and displayed in the Hosts table. At this point the host is considered to be
a spider bottleneck, and most spiders will be stuck waiting to add data to
the host.
<br><br>
If Gigablast is configured to "use merge tokens", (which no longer works for some reason and has since been disabled) then any file merge operation
may be postponed if another instance of Gigablast is performing a merge on the
same computer's IDE bus, or if the twin of the host is merging. This is done
mostly for performance reasons. File merge operations tend to decrease disk
access times, so having a handy twin and not bogging down an IDE bus allows
Gigablast's load balancing algorithms to redirect requests to hosts that are
not involved with a big file merge.
<br>

<a name="deletingrecs"></a>
<h3>Deleting Rdb Records</h3>
The last bit of the 12 bytes key, key_t, is called the delbit. It is 0 if the
key is a "negative key", it is 1 if the key is a "positive key". When 
performing a merge, a negative key may collide with its positive counterpart
thus annihilating one another. Therefore, deletes are performed by taking the
key of the record you want to delete, changing the low bit from a 1 to a 0,
and then adding that key to the database. Negative keys are always dataless.
<br>

<a name="readingrecs"></a>
<h3>Reading a List of Rdb Records</h3>
When a user requests a list of records, Gigablast will read the records
in the key range from each file. If no more than X bytes of records are
requested, then Gigablast will read no more than X bytes from each file. After
the reading, it merges the lists from each file into a final list. During this
phrase it will also annihilate positive keys with their negative counterparts.
<br><br>
<a name="rdbmap"></a>
In order to determine where to start reading in each file for the database,
Gigablast uses a "map file". The map file, encompassed by <b>RdbMap.cpp</b>,  
records the key of the first record
that occurs on each disk page. Each disk page is PAGE_SIZE bytes, currently,
16k. In addition to recording the key of the first record that start on
each page, it records a 2 byte offset of the key into that page. The map file
is represented by the RdbMap class.
<br><br>
The Msg3::readList() routine is used retrieve a list of Rdb records from 
a local Rdb. Like most Msg classes, it allows you to specify a callback
function and callback data in case it blocks. The Msg5 class contains the Msg3
class and extends it with the error correction (discussed below) and caching
capabilities. Calling Msg5::getList() also allows you to incorporate the
lists from the RdbTree in order to get realtime data. Msg3 is used mostly
by the file merge operation.
<br>

<a name="errorcorrection"></a>
<h3>Rdb Error Correction</h3>
Every time a list of records is read, either for answering a query or for
doing a file merge operation, it is checked for corruption. Right now
just the order of the keys of the records, and if those keys are out of the
requested key range, are checked. Later, checksums may
be implemented as well. If some keys are found to be out of order or out
of the requested key range, the request
for the list is forwared to that host's twin. The twin is a mirror image. 
If the twin has the data intact, it returns its data across the network,  
but the twin will return all keys it has in that range, not just necessarily from a single file, thus we can end up patching the corrupted data with a list that is hundreds of times bigger.
Since this
procedure also happens during a file merge operation, merging is a way of
correcting the data.
<br><br>
If there is no twin available, or the twin's data is corrupt as well, then
Gigablast attempts to excise the smallest amount of data so as to regain
integrity. Any time corruption is encountered it is noted in the log with
a message like:
<pre>

<a name="msg0"></a>
<h3>Getting a List of Records from Rdb in a Network</h3>
<b>Msg0.cpp</b> is used to retrieve a list of Rdb records from an abritrary
host. Indexdb is currently the only database where lists of records are
needed. All the other databases pretty much just do single key lookups. Each
database chooses how to partition its records based on the key across the
many hosts in a network. For the most part, the most significant bits of the
key are used to determine which host is responsible for storing that record.
This is why Gigablast is currently limited to running on 2, 4, 8, 16 ... or 
2^n machines. Msg0 should normally be used to get records, not Msg5 or Msg3.
<br>

<a name="netadds"></a>
<a name="msg1"></a>
<h3>Adding a Record to Rdb in a Network</h3>
You can add record to a local instance of Rdb by using Rdb::addRecord() and
you can use Rdb::deleteRecord() to delete records. But in order to add a
record to a remote host you must use <b>Msg1.cpp</b>. This class
will use the key of the record to determine which host or hosts in the network
are responsible for storing the record. It will continue to send the add
request to each host until it receives a positive reply. If the host receiving
the record is down, the add operation will not complete, and will keep
retrying forever.
<br>


<a name="varkeysize"></a>
<h3>Variable Key Size</h3>
As of June 2005, Rdb supports a variable key size. Before, the key was always of class <i>key_t</i> as defined in types.h as being 12 bytes. Now the key can be 16 bytes as well. The key size, either 12 or 16 bytes, is passed into the Rdb::init() function. MAX_KEY_BYTES is currently #define'd as being 16, so if you ever use a key bigger than 16 bytes that must be updated. Furthermore, the functions for operating on key_t's, while still available, have been generalized to accept a key size parameter. These functions are in types.h as well, and the more popular ones are KEYSET() and KEYCMP() for setting and comparing variable sized keys.
<br><br>
To convert the Rdb files from a fixed-size key to a variable-sized one required modifying the files of the Associated Classes (listed above). Essentially, all variables of type key_t were changed to character pointers (char *), and all key assignment and comparison operators (and others) were changed to use the more general KEYSET() and KEYCMP() functions in types.h. To maintain backwards compatibility and ease migration, all Rdb associated classes still accept key_t parameters, but now they also accept character pointer parameters for passing in keys.
<br><br>
Some of the more common bugs from this change: since the keys are now character pointers, data owned by one class often got overwritten by another, therefore you have to remember to copy the key using KEYSET() rather than just operator on the key that the pointer points to. Another common mistake is using the KEYCMP() function without having a comparison operator immediately following in, such as < > = or !=. Also tossing the variable key size, m_ks, around and keeping it in agreement is another weak point. There were some cases of leaving a statement like <i>(char *)&key</i> alone when it should have been changed to just <i>key</i> since it was made into a <i>(char *)</i> from a <i>key_t</i>. And a case of not dealing with the 6-byte compression correctly, like replacing <i>6</i> with <i>m_ks-6</i> when we should not have, like in RdbList::constrain_r(). Whenever possible, the original code was left intact and simply commented out to aid in future debugging.
<br>

<a name="posdb"</a>
<h2>Posdb</h2>
Indexdb was replaced with Posdb in 2012 in order to store <b>word position</b> information as well as what <b>field</b> the word was contained in. Word position information is basically the position of the word in the document and starts at position <i>0</i>. A sequence of whitespace is counted as one, and a sequence of punctuation containing a comma or something else is counted as 2. An alphanumeric word is counted as one. So in the sentence "The quick, brown" the word <i>brown</i> would have a word position of 5. The <b>field</b> of the word in the document could be the title, a heading, a meta tag, the text of an inlink or just the plain document body. 
<br><br>

The 18-byte key for an Posdb record has the following bitmap:

<pre>
tttttttt tttttttt tttttttt tttttttt  t = termId (48bits)
tttttttt tttttttt dddddddd dddddddd  d = docId (38 bits)

<br>
Posdb.cpp tries to rank documents highest that have the query terms closest together. If most terms are close together in the body, but one term is in the title, then there is a slight penalty. This penalty as well as the weights applied to the different density ranks, siteranks, etc are in the Posdb.h and Posdb.cpp files.

<a name="indexdb"></a>
<a name="indexlist"></a>
<h2>Indexdb</h2>
Indexdb has been replaced by <a href="#posdb">Posdb</a>, but the key for an Indexdb record has the following bitmap:

<pre>
tttttttt tttttttt tttttttt tttttttt  t = termid (48bits)
tttttttt tttttttt ssssssss dddddddd  s = ~score
dddddddd dddddddd dddddddd dddddd0Z  d = docId (38 bits)  Z = delbit
</pre>

When Rdb::m_useHalfKeys is on and the preceeding key as the same 6 bytes as
the following key, then the following key, called a half key, only requires 
6 bytes, therefore, has the following bitmap:

<pre>
ssssssss dddddddd dddddddd dddddddd  d = docId, s = ~score
dddddddd dddddd1Z                    Z = delbit
</pre>

Every term that Gigablast indexes, be it a word or phrase, is hashed using
the hash64() routine in the hash.h. This is a very fast and effective hashing
function. The resulting hash of the term is called the termid. It is 
constrained to 48 bits.  
<br><br>
Next, the score of that term is computed. Generally, the more times the term 
occurs in the document the higher the score. Other factors, like incoming 
links and link text and quality of the document, may contribute to the score 
of the term. The score is 4 bytes but is logarithmically mapped into 8 bits, 
and complemented, so documents with higher scores appear above those with 
lower scores, since the Rdb is sorted in ascending order. 
<br><br>
The &lt;indexdbTruncationLimit&gt; parameter in gb.conf, reflected as 
Conf::m_indexdbTruncationLimit, allows you to specify the maximum 
number of docids allowed per termid. This allows you to save disk space. Right 
now it is set to 5 million, a fairly hefty number. The merge routine,
RdbList::indexMerge_r() will ensure that no returned Indexdb list violates
this truncation limit. This routine is used for reading data for resolving
queries as well as doing file merge operations.
A list of Indexdb records all with the same termid, is called a termlist or
indexlist.
<br><br>

<a name="datedb"></a>
<h2>Datedb</h2>
The key for an Datedb record has the following 16-byte bitmap:

<pre>
tttttttt tttttttt tttttttt tttttttt  t = termId (48bits)
tttttttt tttttttt DDDDDDDD DDDDDDDD  D = ~date
DDDDDDDD DDDDDDDD ssssssss dddddddd  s = ~score
dddddddd dddddddd dddddddd dddddd0Z  d = docId (38 bits)

And, similar to indexdb, datedb also has a half bit for compression down to 10 bytes:

                  DDDDDDDD DDDDDDDD  D = ~date
DDDDDDDD DDDDDDDD ssssssss dddddddd  s = ~score
dddddddd dddddddd dddddddd dddddd1Z  d = docId (38 bits)

</pre>
Datedb was added along with variable-sized keys (mentioned above). It is basically the same as indexdb, but has a 4-byte date field inserted. IndexTable.cpp was modified slightly to treat dates as scores in order to provide sort by date functionality. By setting the sdate=1 cgi parameter, Gigablast should limit the termlist lookups to Datedb. Using date1=X and date2=Y cgi parameters will tell Gigablast to constrain the termlist by those dates. date1 and date2 are currently seconds since the epoch. Gigablast will search for the date of a document in this order, stopping at the first non-zero date value:<br>
1. &lt;meta name=datenum content=123456789&gt;<br>
2. &lt;meta name=date content="Dec 1 2006"&gt;<br>
3. The last modified date in the HTTP mime that the web server returns.
<br><br>

<a name="titledb"></a>
<a name="titlerec"></a>
<h2>Titledb</h2>
Titledb holds a cached copy of every web page in the index. The TitleRec
class is used to serialize and deserialize the information from an Rdb record
into something more useful. It also uses the freely available zlib library
to compress web pages to about 1/5th of their size. Depending on the word
density on a page and the truncation limit, Titledb is usually slightly bigger
than Indexdb. See TitleRec.h to see what kind of information is contained
in a TitleRec.
<br><br>
The key of a Titledb record, a TitleRec, has the following bitmap:

<pre>
dddddddd dddddddd dddddddd dddddddd  d = docId
dddddddd hhhhhhhh hhhhhhhh hhhhhhhh  h = hash of site name
hhcccccc cccccccc cccccccc cccccccD  c = content hash, D = delbit
</pre>

The low bits of the top 31 bits of the docId are used to determine which
host in the network stores the Titledb record. See Titledb::getGroupId().
<br><br>
The hash of the sitename is used for doing site clustering. The hash of the
content is used for deduping identical pages from the search results.
<br><br>
<b>IMPORTANT:</b> Any time you change TITLEREC_VERSION in Titledb.h or make 
any parsing change to TitleRec.cpp, you must also change it in all parent bk 
respositories to keep things backwards compatible. We need to ensure that
newer versions of gb can parse the Titledb records of older versions. Because
if you increment TITLEREC_VERSION in the newer repository and then someone
else increments it for a different reason in the parent repository, then you
end up having a conflict as to what the latest version number actually stands
for. So versions need to be immediately propagated both ways to avoid this.
<a name="spiderdb"></a>
<h2>Spiderdb</h2>
NOTE: this description of spiderdb is very outdated! - matt Aug 2013.
<br><br>
Spiderdb is responsible for the spidering schedule. Every url in spiderdb is
either old or new. If it is already in the index, it is old, otherwise, it is
new. The urls in Spiderdb are further categorized by a priority from 0 to 7.
If there are urls ready to be spidered in the priority 7 queue, then they
take precedence over urls in the priority 6 queue. 
<br><br>
All the urls in Spiderdb priority queue are sorted by the date they are
scheduled to be spidered. Typically, a url will not be spidered before its
time, but you can tweak the window in the Spider Controls page. Furthermore,
you can turn the spidering of new or old urls on and off, in addition to
disabling spidering based on the priority level. Link harvesting can also be
toggled based on the spider queue. This way you can harvest links only from
higher priority spider queues.
<br><br>
<a name="pagereindex"></a>
Some spiderdb records are docid based only and will not have an associated url.
These records were usually added from the <b>PageReindex.cpp</b> tool which 
allows the user to store the docids of a bunch of search results directly into 
spiderdb for respidering.
<br><br>
The bitmap of a key in Spiderdb:

<pre>
00000000 00000000 00000000 pppNtttt  t = time to spider, p = ~ of priority
tttttttt tttttttt tttttttt ttttRRf0  R = retry #, f = forced?
dddddddd dddddddd dddddddd dddddddD  d = top 32 bits of docId, D = delbit
                                     N = 1 iff url not in titledb (isNew)
</pre>

Each Spiderdb record also records the number of times the url was tried and
failed. In the Spider Controls you can specify how many until Gigablast gives
up and deletes the url from Spiderdb, and possibly from the other databases
if it was indexed.
<br><br>
If a url was "forced", then it was added to Spiderdb even though it was 
detected as already being in there. Urldb lets us know if a url is in Spiderdb
or not. So if the url is added to Spiderdb even though it is in there already
it is called "forced" url. Once a forced url is spidered then that Spiderdb
record is discarded. Otherwise, if the url was spidered and was not forced,
it is rescheduled for a future spidering, and the old Spiderdb record is
deleted and a new one is added.
<br><br>
Gigablast attempts to determine if the url changed since its last spidering.
If it has, then it will try to decrease the time between spiderings, otherwise
it will try to increase that time. The min and max respider times can be
specified in the Spider Controls page, so you can ensure Gigablast does not
wait long enough or ensure it does not wait too long between respiderings.

<a name="urldb"></a>
<h2>Urldb</h2>
Urldb is like a map file. A record in urldb has this bitmap:

<pre>
00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000  H = half bit
00000000 dddddddd dddddddd dddddddd  d = 36 bit docId
dddddddd ddddddee eeeeefff fffffCHD  e = url hash ext, f = title file # (tfn)
                                     C = clean bit , D = delbit
</pre>

When a caller requests the cached web page for a docid they are essentially requesting the TitleRec for that docid. We have to read the TitleRec from a Titledb file. Because there can be hundreds of titledb files, checking
each one is a burden. Therefore, we ask urldb which one has it. If the title
file number (tfn) is 255, that means the url is just in the Spiderdb OR the TitleRec is in Titledb's RdbTree. The tfn is a secondary numeric identifier present in the actual filename of each titledb file. Only titledb files have this seconday id and it is the number immediately following the hyphen.
<br><br>
The purpose of urldb originally grew from the fact that looking up an old titlerec for re-spidering purposes would require looking in a few files. This was a big bottleneck for the spidering process and also made it harder to handle large query volumes while spidering in the background. Furthermore, much merging was required to keep the number of titledb big files down to a respectable few. Urldb solves this problem by mapping each docid directly to a single titledb file.
<br><br>
Urldb also greatly complicates things. It has to remain in perfect sync with titledb. Every time titledb files are merged the tfn of each TitleRec involved is changed. So right after we dump out the titledb list we add a urldb list to urldb that has the new tfns for the titledbs in that list. This is done in RdbDump::updateUrldbLoop(). Furthermore, since we often merge titledb files in a somewhat random nature, we can not just override the urldb rec for each TitleRec involved in that merge, because a more uptodate TitleRec for the same docid may be in another titledb file. Therefore, we must also read the corresponding urldb lists for the titledb lists involved in the merge, and lookup the uptodate tfn of each TitleRec. If it is indeed a match for the file being merged, then we can do the urldb override.
<br><br>
When a new url is added to the spider queue, via Msg10, we first check urldb to see if it's already in there. We extend the probable docid of the url with the 7-bit hash extension (the number of bits is now #defined as URLDB_EXTBITS in Urldb.h so we can use 23 bits for massive collections) to help reduce collisions and/or false positives. We lookup a range of urldb records, corresponding to all the possible actual docids that that url might have taken if it was indexed earlier. This list is looked up in Msg10::addUrlLoop(). The keys defining the list are uk1 and uk2. If any urldb record in that list has the same hash extension as the url being added then we consider the url to already be in the index or in a spider queue, even though it may not. The probability is low.
<br><br>
If the url is determined not to be in urldb then it is added to spiderdb and also to urldb. We use the same probable docid and hash extension when adding it to urldb, and we use a tfn of 255 to indicate that it is in a spider queue only. (NOTE: this can also mean it is indexed, and its TitleRec is in the tree in memory as well). When we finally index a new url we actually do not add its urldb record to urldb since Msg22 will check the RdbTree first for any titleRec before even bothering with urldb. However, if the actual docid of the new url turns out to be different because it collided with the actual docid of an existing, indexed url, then we remove its old record from urldb, and we do add the new record with the actual docid (TODO). This logic is contained in Msg14::addUrlRecs().
<br><br>
If reindexing an old url, we do not re-add the urldb record with a tfn of 255 because it is not efficient and because Msg22 will check the RdbTree for the titleRec before consulting Titledb.
<br><br>
When merging urldb lists in RdbList::indexMerge_r() we ignore the tfn bits. That allows the tfns of newer urldb recs to override those of older urldb recs. The tfns are really not meant to be part of the key, they are just data that we never need to sort by, but we cram them into the key to save space.
<br><br>
We try to keep all of the Urldb records in memory. Not necessarily in the RdbTree, but in a disk page cache. Therefore, try to keep urldbMaxDiskPageCacheMem bigenough to hold the entire Urldb in memory. This speeds up things a good bit. Urldb also takes heavy advantage of using half keys for compression, as described above under Indexdb. Urldb's disk page cache is also biased, that is, lower docids are looked up on one host, and higher docids are looked up on that host's twin. This split, or biases, the cache making it twice as effective. If more than two hosts are in a group (shard), then it will split the cache across all of them equally. This logic is in Msg22.cpp. (search for "bias" in that file).
<br><br>
Everytime Titledb files are merged, the affected docids must be updated in 
Urldb, but because Urldb is so much smaller than Titledb, it does not inhibit
performance.
<br><br>
Msg14::addUrlRecs() will update urldb directly via Msg1 when Msg14 deletes, adds or updates a titledb record.
<br><br>
In conclusion, Urldb is for the performance benefit of Msg22 (used to lookup a TitleRec from a docid or url) and Msg10 (used to add a url to a spider queue). Without it, things would be *much* slower. Hooray for Urldb.

Sitedb maps a url to a site file number (sfn). The site file is now called
a <a href="overview.html#ruleset">ruleset</a> file and has the name sitedbN.xml in the 
working directory.  All rulesets must be archived in the Bitkeeper repository at /gb/conf/. Therefore, all gb clusters share the same ruleset name space. <b>Msg8.cpp</b> and <b>Msg9.cpp</b> are used to 
respectively get and set sitedb records.

<a name="catdb"></a>
<h2>Catdb</h2>

<pre>
dddddddd dddddddd dddddddd dddddddd  d = domain hash
uuuuuuuu uuuuuuuu uuuuuuuu uuuuuuuu  u = special url hash
uuuuuuuu uuuuuuuu uuuuuuuu uuuuuuuu

Data Block:
 . number of catides (1 byte)
 . list of catids    (4 bytes each)
 . sitedb file #     (3 bytes)
 . sitedb version #  (1 byte)
 . siteUrl (remaining bytes)
</pre>

Catdb is a special implementation of Sitedb.  While it is similar in that
a single record is stored per url and the keys are created using the same
hashes, the record stores additional category information about the url.
This includes how many categories the url is in and which categories it is in
(their ids).  Like sitedb, Msg8 and Msg9 are used to get and set catdb.  Msg2a
is used to generate a full catdb using directory information and calling Msg9.
<br><br>
Catdb is only used at spider time for the spider to lookup urls
and see if they are in the directory and which categories they are under.
A url's category information is stored in its TitleRec and is also indexed
using special terms (see below).

<h3>dmozparse</h3>
The program "dmozparse" is implemented individually and allows for the
creation of proprietary data files using the RDF data available from DMOZ.
Dmozparse will create two main data files, gbdmoz.content.dat and
gbdmoz.structure.dat.  gbdmoz.content.dat stores a list of url strings and
their associated category IDs.  This is used to populate catdb.
gbdmoz.structure.dat stores and list of category names, their IDs, their
parent IDs, their offsets into the original RDF files, and the number of urls
present in each category.  The offsets are used to lookup more complex
information about the categories, such as sub-category lists and titles and
summaries for urls.
See the Overview for proper use of dmozparse.

<h3>Msg2a</h3>
<a name="msg2a"></a>
Catdb is generated using Msg2a, which reads the gbdmoz.content.dat file
generated by dmozparse and sets the Catdb records accordingly with Msg9.
Msg2a is also used to update Catdb when new data is available.
See the Overview for proper building and updating of Catdb.

<h3>Categories</h3>
The Categories class is used to store the Directory's hierarchy and provide
general functionality when dealing with the directory.  It is instanced
as the global "g_categories".  The hierarchy is loaded from the
gbdmoz.structure.dat file when Gigablast starts.  Categories provides an
interface to lookup and print category names based on their ID.  Titles
and Summaries for a given url in a category may also be looked up.  Categories
also provides the ability to generate a list of sub-categories for a given
categories, which is used by Msg2b (see below).

<a name="msg2b"></a>
<h3>Msg2b</h3>
Msg2b is used to generate and sort a category's directory listing.  This
includes the sub-categories, related categories, and other languages of the
given category.  Input is given as the category ID to generate the directory
listing for.  Msg2b will store the listing internally.  This is primarily used
by PageResults to make a DMOZ style directory which can be browsed by users.

<h3>Indexed Catids, Direct and Indirect</h3>
When a url that is in the directory gets spidered, the IDs of the categories
the url is in are indexed.  For the exact categories the url appears in,
the prefix "gbdcat" is hashed with the category id.  For all parent
categories of these categories, the prefix "gbpdcat" is used.  The base
categores the url is in will also be indexed with "gbpdcat".  These are
considered "direct" catids.
<br><br>
All urls which are under a sub-url that is in the directory will have
category IDs indexed as "indirect" catids.  All of the direct catids
associated with the sub-url will be indexed using the prefixes "gbicat"
and "gbpicat".
<br><br>
Indexing the direct catids allows for a fast lookup of all the urls under a
category.  Searches can also be restricted to single categories, either the
base category itself or the inclusion of all sub-categories.  Indirect
catids allows pages under those listed in a category to be searched as well.

<br><br>

<h2>The UDP Server</h2>
The <b>UdpServer.cpp</b>, <b>UdpSlot.cpp</b> and <b>UdpProtocol.h</b> 
classes constitute the framework
for Gigablast's UDP server, a fast and reliable method for transmitting data
between hosts in a Gigablast network.
<br><br>
Gigablast uses two instances of the UdpServer class. One of them,
g_udpServer2, uses asynchronous signals to reply to received dgrams by
interrupting the current process. g_udpServer is not asynchronous. The asynchronous instance is not really used any more since the 2.4.31 kernel does not seem to really support it because ping replies were not instant under heavy load.
<br><br>
The way it works is that the caller calls g_udpServer.sendRequest ( ... )
to send a message. The receiving host will get a signal that the udp socket
descriptor is ready for reading. It will then peek at the datagram using the
read ( ... , MSG_PEEK , ... ) call to get the transid (transaction id) from 
the datagram. The transid is either associated with an existing UdpSlot or a
new UdpSlot is created to handle the transaction. The UdpSlots are stored in
a fixed-size array, so if you run out of them, the incoming datagram will
be silently dropped and will be re-sent later.
<br><br>
When a UdpSlot is selected to receive a datagram, it then calls 
UdpSlot::sendAck() to send back an ACK datagram packet. When the sender
receives the ACK it sets a bit in UdpSlot::m_readAckBits[] to indicate it has 
done so. Likewise, UdpSlot::m_sendAckBits[] are updated on the machine 
receving the message, and m_readBits[] and m_sendBits[] are used to keep track
of what non-ACK datagrams have been read or sent respectively.
<br><br>
Gigablast will send up to ACK_WINDOW_SIZE (defined in UdpSlot.cpp as 12) 
non-ACK datagrams before it requires an ACK to send more. If doing a local send
then Gigablast will send up to ACK_WINDOW_SIZE_LB (loopback) datagrams.
<br><br>
If the sending host has not received an ACK datagram within RESEND_0 
(defined to be 33 in UdpSlot.cpp) milliseconds, it will resend the datagrams 
that have not been ACKed. If the host is sending on g_udpServer, then RESEND_1
(defined to be 100 in UdpSlot.cpp) milliseconds is used. If sending a short
message (under one datagram in size) then RESEND_0_SHORT (33 ms) is used. The
resends are taken care of in in UdpServer::timePoll() which is called every
20ms for g_udpServer2 (defined in main.cpp) and every 60ms for g_udpServer.
<br><br>
Each datagram can be up to DGRAM_SIZE bytes. You can make this up to 64k
and let the kernel deal with chopping the datagrams up into IP packets that
fit under the MTU, but unfortunately, the new 2.6 kernel does not allow you
to send datagrams larger than the MTU over the loopback device. Datagrams
sent over the loopback device can be up to DGRAM_SIZE_LB bytes, and datagrams
used by the Dns class can be up to DGRAM_SIZE_DNS bytes.
<br><br>
The UdpProtocol class is used to define and parse the header used by each 
datagram. The Dns class derives its DnsProtocl class from UdpProtocol in
order to use the proper DNS headers.
<br><br>
The bitmap of the header used by the UdpProtocol class is the following:
<pre>
REtttttt ACNnnnnn nnnnnnnn nnnnnnnn  R = is Reply?, E = hadError? N=nice
iiiiiiii iiiiiiii iiiiiiii iiiiiiii  t = msgType, A = isAck?, n = dgram #
ssssssss ssssssss ssssssss ssssssss  i = transId C = cancelTransAck
dddddddd dddddddd dddddddd dddddddd  s = msgSize (iff !ack) (w/o hdrs!)
dddddddd ........ ........ ........  d = msg content ...
</pre>

The niceness (N bit) of a datagram can be either 0 or 1. If it is 0 (not nice)
then it will take priority over a datagram with a niceness of 1. This just 
means that we will call the handlers for it first. It's not a very big deal.
<br><br>
The datagram number (n bits) are used to number the datagrams so we can
re-assemble them in the correct order.
<br><br>
The message type corresponds to all of the Msg*.cpp classes you see in the
source tree. The message type also maps to a pointer to a function, called the 
handler function, which generates and sends back a reply. This map (array) of 
pointers to handler functions is UdpServer::m_handlers[]. Each Msg*.cpp class
must call g_udpServer2.registerHandler() to register its handler function for
its message type. Its handler function will be called when a complete request of its message type (msgType) is received.
<br><br>
The handler function must set the UdpSlot's (UDP socket) m_requestBuf to NULL if it does not want UdpServer to free it. More likely, however, is that when receiving a <b>reply</b> from the UdpServer you will want to set UdpSlot::m_readBuf to NULL so the UdpServer doesn't free it, but then, of course, you are responsible for freeing it.
<br><br>


<a name="multicasting"></a>
<a name="multicast"></a>
<h2>Multicasting</h2>
The <b>Multicast.cpp</b> class is also considered part of the network layer. 
It takes a request and broadcasts it to a set of twin hosts. It can do this in 
one of two ways. One way is to send the request to a set of twin hosts and 
not complete until all hosts have sent back a reply. This method 
is used when adding data. Gigablast needs to add data to a host and all of 
its mirrors for the add to be considered a success. So if one host crashes 
and is not available to receive the data, the requester will keep re-sending 
the request to that host until it comes back online. 
<br><br>
The second broadcast method employed by Multicast.cpp is used mainly for 
reading data. If m_loadBalancing is true, it will send an asynchronous
request to each host (using Msg34.cpp) in a set of twin hosts to determine the load on each host.
Once it knows the load of each host, the multicast will forward the request to 
the least loaded host. If, for some reason, the selected host does not reply 
within a set amount of time (depends on the message type -- see Multicast.cpp) 
then the request will be re-routed to another host in the set of twins.

All of the Msg*.cpp files correspond to network messages. Most of them are
requests. See the classes that start with Msg* for explanations in the

<h2>The DNS Resolver</h2>
<br>
Originally Dns.cpp was built to interface with servers running the bind9 
DNS program. A query containing the hostname would be sent to a bind9 process
(which was selected based on the hash of the hostname)
and the bind9 process would
perform the recursive DNS lookups and return the final answer, the IP address
of that hostname.
<br><br>
However, since the advent of the 256 node cluster, we've had to run multiple
instances of bind9, like about 10 of them, just to support the spider load.
Rather than have to worry about if these processes or servers go down, or 
if the processes get terminated, or contend too much for memory or cpu with
the Gigablast processes they share the server with, we decided to just replace
bind9's recursive lookup functionality with about 400 lines of additional
code the Dns.cpp. This also serves to make the code base more independent.
<br><br>Dns::getIp() is the entry point to Dns.cpp's functionality. It will
create a UDP datagram query and send it to a nameserver (DNS server). It
will expect to get back the IP address of the hostname in the query or receive
an error packet, or timeout. Now, since bind9 is out of the loop, we have
to direct the request to a root DNS server. The root servers will refer us
to TLD root servers which will then refer us to others, etc. Sometimes 
the nameservers we are referred to do not have their IPs listed in the reply
and so we have to look those up on the side. Also, we often are referred to
a list of servers to ask, and so if any of those timeout we have to move to
the next in the list. This explains the nature of the DnsState
class which is used to keep our information persistent as we wait for replies.
<br><br>
DnsState has an m_depth member which is 0 when we ask the root servers,
1 when we ask the TLD root servers, etc. m_depth is used to offset us into
an array of DNS IPs, m_dnsIps[], and an array of DNS names, m_dnsNames[], which
unfortunately do not have IPs included and most be looked up should we need 
to ask them. Furthermore, at each depth we are limited to MAX_DNS_IPS IP
addresses and MAX_DNS_IPS DNS names. So if we get referred to more than
that many IP addesses we will truncate the list. This value is a hefty 32 right
now, and that is per depth level. MAX_DEPTH is about 7. That is how many times
we can be referred to other nameservers before giving up and returning
ETIMEDOUT. We also avoid asking the same IP address twice by keeping a list
of m_triedIps in the DnsState. And DnsState has an m_buf buffer that is used
for allocating extra DnsStates for doing IP lookups on nameservers we are 
referred to but have no IPs given in the response. We can use m_buf to 
recursively create
up to 3 DnsStates before giving up. For instance, if we are trying to get
the IP of a nameserver, and we are referred to 2 more nameservers, without IPs,
so we must use the DnsState, etc.
<br><br>
To avoid duplicate parallel IP lookups we use s_table, which is a hashtable
using the HashTableT.cpp class in which each bucket is a CallbackEntry, which
consists of a callback function and a state. So Dns::getIp() will use the 
hostname you want to get an IP for as the key into this hash table. If there
is a CallbackEntry for that key then you must wait in line because someone
has already sent out a request for that hostname. The line is kept in the form
of a linked list. Each CallbackEntry has an m_nextKey member, too, which
refers to the key of the next CallbackEntry in s_table waiting on that same
hostname. However, the people that are not first in line use a s_bogus for
their key, since all keys in the hash table must be unique. And s_bogus key
is a long long that is incremented each time so it is used, so it should never
ever wrap, since a long long is absolutely huge, like beyond astronomical.
<br><br>
We also cache timeouts into the RdbCache for about a day. That way we do not
bottleneck on them forever. Other errors were always cached, but not timeouts
until now. 
We now also support a TTL in the cache. Every DNS reply has a TTL
which specifies for how long the IP is good for and we put that into the
cache. We actually limit it to MAX_DNS_CACHE_AGE which is currently set to
2 days (it is in seconds).
We may want to cache some resource records, so, for instance, we do
not have to keep asking the root servers for the TLD servers if we know what
they are. 
And along the lines of future performance enhancements, 
we may want to consider asking
multiple nameservers, launching the requests within about a second of each
other. And, if a reply comes back for a slot that was timedout, we should 
probably still entertain it as a late reply.
<br><br>
DNS debug messages can be turned on at any time from the log tab. It is often
helpful to use dig to assist you. like
<i>dig @1.2.3.4 xyz.com +norecurse</i> will show you DNS 1.2.3.4 server's
response to a request for the IP of xyz.com. And <i>dig xyz.com +trace</i>
will show you all the servers and replies dig communes with to resolve a
hostname to its IP address. dig also seems to get IPv6 IP addresses whereas
the Gigablast resolver does not work on. This may be something to support 
later.

This section describes how Gigablast downloads, parses, scores and indexes documents. 

<!--<b>SpiderLoop.cpp</b>'s spiderUrl() routine is called every 30ms or so by Loop.cpp to spider a new url. If spiders are deactivated then it just returns, otherwise, it tries to get a url from <a href="#spiderdb">spiderdb</a> to spider. If successful, it allocates a new Msg14 class and passes the url to that. Msg14 downloads, parses and scores the document, and ultimately adds records to indexdb, titledb, clusterdb and checksumdb for that document. Alternately, urls and their corresponding content can be directly injected using the injection interface, <b>PageInject.cpp</b>, which calls a Msg14 directly.

<h2>The Spider Loop</h2>
<b>SpiderLoop.cpp</b> finds what URLs in <a href="#spiderdb">spiderdb</a> to spider next. It is based on the URL filters table that you can specify in the admin interface. It calls XmlDoc::index() to download and index the URL.
<br><br>

<!--
<a name="spidercache"></a>
<a name="spidercollection"></a>
<a name="spiderqueue"></a>
<h2>The Spider Cache</h2>
To avoid doing a disk seek into spiderdb in an attempt to get a url to spider, 
Gigablast preloads the urls from spiderdb into its Spider Cache, as defined
in <b>SpiderCache.cpp</b>. It uses a global instance, g_spiderCache, for all
collections.  The Spider Cache will store the spider records it
loads in an instance of <a href="#rdbtree">RdbTree</a> called s_tree. 
It basically uses the same
key in s_tree as it does in spiderdb, but it changes the timestamp in the key
so as to
fill the tree with as diverse a selection as domains as possible, to avoid
one domain from dominating the tree, and thereby blocking urls from the other
domains from getting indexed. A count of each domain added to s_tree is 
recorded in a hash table, and that count is multiplied by the 
<i>sameDomainWait</i> parm to come up with a new timestamp for the s_tree key.
Other than that, the s_tree key is the same as the spiderdb key.
<br><br>
<i>sameIpWait</i> is similar to <i>sameDomainWait</i> but is based on IP,
and is mainly used to prevent Gigabot from hammering websites with multiple
domains hounsed under a single IP address. Since IP addresses are not 
currently stored
in a Spiderdb record, Gigablast will perform the IP lookup at spider time
and cache it in SpiderCache::s_localDnsCache so it can quickly check that
IP cache when it is loading the urls from disk. Additionally, SpiderCache
uses s_domWaitTable and s_ipWaitTable to record the last download times
of a url from a particular domain or IP.
<br><br>
SpiderCache is divided into a SpiderCollection class for every collection and
SpiderCollection is divided into 16 SpiderQueue classes, one for each possible
spider queue. Remember, there are 8 spider priorities and a spider queue can
contain either old or new urls. SpiderCache::sync() is called to sync up the
SpiderCollections with the actual collections should a collection be added
or deleted. SpiderCache::addSpiderRec() is called to try to add a Spiderdb
record to the cache, actually an RdbTree called s_tree. 
SpiderCache::getNextSpiderRec() is called to a get a Spiderdb record for
spidering. And SpiderCache::doneSpidering() is called when a Spiderdb record
is done being spidered and should be removed from the cache.
SpiderCache::loadLoop() loads records from Spiderdb on disk for spider queues
that are active. It can only be loading one spider queue at a time; this is
ensured by the s_gettingList flag.
<br><br>
SpiderCache uses s_tree, an RdbTree, to hold all of the Spiderdb records that
it contains. SpiderCache does not use a record's Spiderdb key as the key
for s_tree,
rather it uses a specially computed cache key. This cache key is essentially
the same as the spiderdb record key, but the time stamp is changed to reflect a
score. 
This score is essentially linear, starting with 0, but it is increased by 
1000 for every successive url it loads from the same domain or IP address.
This makes getting the next url to spider faster. Also, if a url is not
slated to be spidered until the future then the score is the scheduled time
in seconds since the epoch, the same value that was in the Spiderdb record.
The score is visible in the Spider Queue control.
<br><br>
When looking at the Spider Queue control in Gigablast's web GUI you will note
that there is a "in cache" or "not in cache" control that you can toggle.
Select it to "in cache" and then click on a <i>priority</i> and you will see 
all of the urls in s_tree for that
spider queue. Once there you will note some parameters in the
first row of the table. One is the <i>water</i> parameter. That is how many
urls, max, were loaded into the cache for that spider queue during the last
load time. The <i>loading</i> flag is 1 if Gigablast is currently loading
urls for that spider queue, 0 otherwise. The <i>scanned</i> parameter is
how many bytes have been read trying to load urls for that spider queue, and
<i>elapsed</i> is how much time as elapsed since the start or end of the load,
depending on if the load is in progress or not. <i>bubbles</i> represents
how many attempts were made to get a url to spider from that spider queue, 
but a url was not available from that spider queue. Typically, bubbles are bad
because you always want to give the spider something to do. When a spider queue
bubbles it is often because there are not enough urls available, a load is
going on and needs some more time to load more urls or most of the urls that 
are available are all from the same few domains or IPs and Gigablast does not
want to hammer any particular server because of the "same domain wait" and
"same IP wait" controls. <i>hits</i> is the counterpart of <i>bubbles</i> and
is how many urls were returned for spidering from that spider queue. And 
<i>cached</i> is how many urls are current in s_tree for that spider queue.
<br><br>
Gigablast will only attempt to reload a spider queue when it bubbles and is 
unable to return a url to spider through a call to 
SpiderQueue::getNextSpiderRec(). It will never attempt the reload that
spider queue if less
than SPIDER_RELOAD_RATE seconds have elapsed since the last reload time. 
Currently this is #defined to be 8 minutes. But it can reload without
waiting SPIDER_RELOAD_RATE seconds if the number of urls currently in the
cache for that spider queue are less than half of the water mark for that
spider queue. These 
criteria prevent Gigablast from constantly trying to reload a spider queue
just because it consists of, say, 100,000 urls from the same domain and is
constantly bubbling.
<br><br>
When loading spider records, SpiderCache::addSpiderRec() is called for every
spider record loaded. All of the filtering logic is in there. Each spider queue
can have up to MAX_CACHED_URLS_PER_QUEUE urls in its part of the s_tree cache.
Currently this is #defined to be 50000. If you try to add a Spiderdb record
to a spider queue cache that is at this limit, then Gigablast will score that
spider record and attempt to kick out a lower scoring spider record if 
possible. When links are spidered, Msg10 will often call 
g_spiderCache::addSpiderRec() to attempt
to add the new links to the appropriate cached spider queue and take advantage
of this kick-out logic.
<br><br>
When loading urls from spiderdb into s_tree,
Gigablast will scan all the urls in spiderdb
for that spider queue in order to get the best possible sampling of domains.
When adding new records to s_tree it may kick out old ones that have a lower
key in order to stay below the 30,000 max url limit per spider priority.
<br><br>
SpiderCache is responsible for adhering to the Conf::m_maxIncomingKbps
and Conf::m_maxPagesPerSecond parameters reflected in the gb.conf file and
the Master Controls web page. It keeps track of the average page size so
that urls that are being fetched, if they haven't already been downloaded,
are assumed to be downloading a page with that average page size. In this
manner Gigablast does a very good job of obeying bandwidth limitations. These
two contraints are also settable on a per collection basis as well.
<br><br>
SpiderCache juggles between various collections. When multiple collections
are being spidered SpiderCache will use the SpiderCache::getRank() function
to determine which collection should provide the next url. This is based on
how long it has been since the collection downloaded a url and on that
collection's CollectionRec::m_maxKbps and CollectionRec::m_maxPagesPerSecond
parameters. If either of these parameters is -2 it means it is unbounded.
<br><br>
-->
<!--
<a name="msg14"></a>
<h2>Msg14</h2>
After the Spider Cache provides a url to spider, Spider Loop allocates a new
Msg14 and passes the url to it for indexing. 
The Spider Loop will call either Msg14::spiderUrl() or Msg14::injectUrl() to
kick off the indexing process. These routines are basically different start
points for the same process, they just initialize a few parameters differently.
<br><br>


<a name="msg15"></a>
<h2>Msg15</h2>
Next Msg14 will call Msg15 which calls Msg22::getTitleRec() which will
attempt to load the old <a href="#titledb">titledb</a> record 
from the provided url or docid.
The titledb record, defined by <b>TitleRec.cpp</b>, is contained in
Msg14::m_oldDoc::m_titleRec.
Msg15 will also set Msg14::m_oldDoc::m_siteRec, a <a href="#sitedb">sitedb</a>
 record, from the site file number contained in that titledb record. 
The site file number, also known as the ruleset number,
corresponds to the <a href="overview.html#ruleset">ruleset</a> that was used to index the
document the last time. The same ruleset number from any gigablast cluster should always correspond to the same sitedb*.xml file in order to avoid namespace collisions. We keep all sitedb*.xml files in /gb/conf/ under Bitkeeper control.
<br><br>
If the <a href="#spiderdb">spiderdb</a> record of the url being spidered 
is marked as "old" but
Msg15 failed to load the old titledb record, then Msg14 will complain in the
log, but keep going regardless. Similarly, if it was marked as "new" in the
spiderdb record, but was found in titledb.
For new urls, urls that are being spidered and are not already in the index,
Msg22 will contain the new actual docid for the url, as described in the 
<a href="#docids">DocIds</a> section. Ultimately, Msg15 will set 
Msg14::m_oldDoc, an instance of the <a href="#doc">Doc</a> class, 
which is central to the parser. 
<br><br>

<a name="msg16"></a>
<h2>Msg16</h2>
In a similar manner, Msg16 will set Msg14::m_newDoc, but Msg16 will actually
download the document, not take it from titledb, unless <i>recycle content</i>
is marked as true on the Spider Controls page. If Msg16 fails to download the
document because of a timeout or other similar error, Msg14 will delete the
document from the index and from spiderdb after <i>max retries</i> times, where
<i>max retries</i> is set from the Spider Controls page and can be as big as 
three. 
<br><br>
Msg16 may end up using a different ruleset to parse the document and set
the Doc class, and ending up with an IndexList a lot different than Msg15's
ruleset.
A ruleset is an XML document describing how to parse and score a document, 
as further described in the
<a href="overview.html#ruleset">Overview</a> document.
<br><br>
Msg16 is also responsible for setting the <a href="#linkinfo">LinkInfo.cpp</a> class. That class is set by Msg25 and is used to increase the link-adjusted
quality of a document based on the number of incoming linkers, as can be seen
on the <a href="pageparser">Page Parser</a> page.
<br><br>

<a name="doc"></a>
<h2>The Doc Class</h2>
Msg15 and Msg16 both set a different instance of the <b>Doc</b> class.
The idea behind the Doc class is that it is ultimately a way to convert an
arbitrary document into an IndexList, defined by <b>IndexList.cpp</b>, 
which is an RdbList of Indexdb records.  Indexlist will convert a 
<a href="#termtable">TermTable</a> class into an <a href="#rdblist">RdbList</a>
format. The TermTable is just a hash
table containing all of the term from the document that are to be indexed.
<br><br>

<a name="linkanalysis"></a>
<a name="linkinfo"></a>
<a name="linktext"></a>
<a name="msg25"></a>
<a name="msg23"></a>
<a name="pageparser"></a>
<h2>Link Analysis</h2>
XmlDoc calls <b>Msg25</b> to set the LinkInfo class for a document. The 
LinkInfo class is stored in the titledb record (the TitleRec) and can be
recycled if <i>recycle link info</i> is enabled in the Spider Controls.
LinkInfo contains an array of <b>LinkText</b> classes. 
Each LinkText class corresponds
to a document that links to the url being spidered, and has an IP address,
a link-adjusted quality and docid of the linker, optional hyperlink text,
a log-spam bit, and the total number of outgoing links the linker has.
Exactly how the incoming link text is indexed and how the linkers affect the
link-adjusted quality of the url being indexed can be easily seen on the
Page Parser tool available through the administrative section or by clicking
on the [analyze] link next to a search result.
<br><br>
Msg25 uses 
<a href="#msg20">Msg20</a> to get information about an inlinker.
It sends a Msg20 request to the machine that has the linking document in its 
<a href="#titledb">titledb</a>. The handler loads the titledb record using
Msg22, and then extracts the relevant link text using the <b>Links.cpp</b>
class, and packages that up with the quality and docid of the linker in the
reply.
<br><br>

<!--
<a name="msg18"></a>
<a name="robotdb"></a>
<h2>Robots.txt</h2>
Msg16 uses <b>Msg18</b> to get the robots.txt page for a url. This request 
uses a
distributed cache, so the request is actually forwarded to a host based on
the hash of the hostname of the url. <b>Robotdb.cpp</b> is used to handle the
caching logic, and the parsing of the robots.txt page. We recently added
support for the Crawl-Delay: directive.
<br><br>

<a name="termtable"></a>
<h2>The TermTable</h2>
This is a big hash table that contains all the terms to be indexed. It is
generated by XmlDoc::set() which essentially takes a titledb record (TitleRec)
and a sitedb record (SiteRec) as input and sets the TermTable as output. Msg14
uses the XmlDoc classes contained in Msg14::m_oldDoc and Msg14::m_newDoc
respectively, setting each with the appropriate TitleRec.
<br><br>
An IndexList can be set from the old and new TermTables using 
IndexList::set(). It essentially subtracts
the two if <i>incremental indexing</i> is enabled in the Master Controls or
gb.conf. That way it will only add new terms or terms that have different 
scores compared to the old TitleRec.
-->

<a name="samplevector"></a>
<h2>The Sample Vector</h2>
After downloading the page, XmlDoc::getPageSampleVector() generates a sample
vector for the document. This vector is formed by getting the top 32 or so 
terms from the new TermTable sorted by their termId, a hash of each term. 
This vector is stored in the TitleRec and used for deduping.
<br><br>

<a name="summaryvector"></a>
<h2>The Summary Vector</h2>
Deduping search results at query time is based partly on how similar the summaries are. We use XmlDoc::getSummaryVector() which takes two sample
vectors as input. The similarity threshold can be controlled from the 
Search Controls' <i>percent similar dedup default</i> and it can also be
explicitly specified using the <i>psc</i> cgi parameter.


<a name="gigabitvector"></a>
<h2>The Gigabit Vector</h2>
Like the Sample Vector, the Gigabit Vector is a sample of the terms in a 
document, but the terms are sorted by scores which are based on the popularity
of the term and on the frequency of the term in the document. 
XmlDoc::getGigabitVector() computes that vector for a TitleRec and makes use
of the <a href="#msg24">Msg24</a> class which gets the gigabits for a document.
The resulting vector is stored in the TitleRec and used to do topic clustering.
<i>cluster by topic</i> can be enabled in the Search Controls, and 
<i>percent similar topic default</i> can be used to tune the clustering
sensitivity so that documents in the search results are only clustered together
if their Gigabit Vectors are X% similar or more. 
<a href="#msg38">Msg38</a> calls Clusterdb::getGigabitSimilarity() 
to compute the similarity of two Gigabit Vectors.
<br><br>

<a name="deduping"></a>
<h2>Deduping at Spider Time</h2>
<i>Last Updated 1/29/2014 by MDW</i>
<br><br>
Many URLs contain essentially the same content as other URLs. Therefore we need to dedup URLs and prevent them from entering the index. Deduping in this fashion is disabled by default so you will need to enabled it in the Spider Controls for your collection. You will note such duplicate urls in the logs with the "Doc is a dup" (<a href=#indexcodes>EDOCDUP</a>) message. Those urls are not indexed, and if they were indexed, they will be removed.
<br><br>
When a page is indexed we store a hash of its content into a single "posdb" key.
We set the "sharded by termid" bit for that posdb key, so it is not sharded by docid which is the norm. Hostdb::getShard() checks for that bit and shards by termid when it is present. In that way all the pages with the same content hash will be together on disk in posdb.
<br><br>
We perform a lookup of all other docids that share the same content hash as the document we are indexing. If another docid has the same content hash and its site rank is the same as ours or higher, then we are a duplicate docid and we do not index our docid and getIndexCode() returns <a href=#indexcode>EDOCDUP</a>. Our document will be deleted if it was indexed. If another docid with the same content hash as us has a siterank lower than ours, then he is the dup and he will be removed when he is reindexed the next time with the <a href=#indexcode>EDOCDUP</a> error. If another docid with the same content hash as us as the SAME site rank as us, then we assume we are the dup. We go first come first server approach in that scenario, site rank trumps.
<br><br>
We use the getContentHashExact64() function to generate the 64-bit dup checksum. It hashes the document pretty much verbatim for safety. It does treat sequences of white space as a single space character however.
<br><br>
Other hash functions exist that hash all the month names and day of week names and ALL DIGITS to a specific number in order to ignore the clocks one finds on web pages. Additionally tags can be ignored unless they are a frame or iframe tag. Pure text is hashed as lower case alnum. Punctuatuation and spaces can be skipped over. This algoritm is currently unused but is available in the getLooseContentHash() function.
<br><br>
If we see a &lt;link href=<i>xxx</i> rel=canonical&gt; tag in the page and our url is different than <i>xxx</i>, then we do not index the url and use the <a href=#indexcode>ENOTCANONICAL</a> error, but we do insrt a spider request for the referenced canonical url so it can get picked up. The error when downloading such urlsshows up as "Url was dup of canonical page" in the logs. The canonical URL we insert should inherit the same SpiderRequest::m_isInjecting or SpiderRequest::m_isAddUrl bits of the "dup" url it came from, similar to how simplified meta redirects work.

<h2>Indexing Error Codes</h2>
When trying to index a document we call XmlDoc::getIndexCode() to see if there was a problem. 0 means everything is good. Typically an error will be indicative of not indexing the document, or sometimes even removing it if it was indexed. Sometimes an error code will just do knowthing except add a SpiderReply to Spiderdb indicating the error so that the document might be tried again in the future. Sometimes, like in the case of simplified meta rediriects we will add the new url's SpiderRequest to spiderdb as well. So we handle all errors on an individual basis.

<a name="xmldoc"></a>
<h2>XmlDoc: The Heart of the Parser</h2>
Spider.cpp ultimately calls XmlDoc::index() to download and index the specified URL. 
<br><br>

<a name="xml"></a>
<h2>Xml</h2>
The Xml class is Gigablast's XML parsing class. You can set it by passing it
a pointer to HTML or XML content along with a content length. If you pass it 
some strange character set, it will convert it to UTF-16 and use that to set 
its nodes. Each node is a tag or a non-tag. It uses the XmlNode
class to tokenize the content into these nodes.
<br><br>

<a name="links"></a>
<h2>Links</h2>
The Links class is set by XmlDoc and gets all the links in a document.
Links::hash(), called by XmlDoc::hash(), will index all the link:, ilink: or 
links: terms.
It is also used to get link text by the <a href="#linktext">LinkText</a> class.
<br><br>

<a name="words"></a>
<h2>Words</h2>
All text documents can be broken up into "words". Gigablast's definition of a 
word is slight different than normal. A word is defined as a sequence of
alphanumeric characters, a sequence of non-alphanumeric characters. An HTML
or XML tag is also considered to be an individual word. Words for Japanese
or other similar languages are determined by a tokenizer Partap integrated.
<br><br>
The Phrases, Bits, Spam and Scores classes all contain arrays which are 1-1
with the Words class they were set from. 
<br><br>
The Words class is primarily used by TermTable::set() which takes a string,
breaks it down into words and phrases and hash them word and phrase ids into
the hash table.
<br><br>

<a name="phrases"></a>
<h2>Phrases</h2>
Gigablast implements phrase searching by stringing words together and hashing
them as a single unit. It uses the Phrases and Bits class to generate phrases
from a Words class. Basically, every pair of words is considered a phrase. So if it sees "cd rom" in the document it will index the bigram "cdrom". It can easily be modified to index trigrams and quadgrams as well, but that will bloat the index somewhat.
<br><br>

<a name="bits"></a>
<h2>Bits</h2>
Before phrases can be generated from a Words class, Gigblast must set 
descriptor bits. Each word has a corresponding character in the Bits class
that sets flags depending on different properties of the word. These bits
are used for generating <a href="#phrases">phrases</a>.
<br><br>

<!--
<a name="scores"></a>
<h2>Scores</h2>
A more recent addition to Gigablast is the Scores class. It was written to
extract the beefy content of a page, and exclude, or reduce the impact of,
menu text. Words with scores of 0 or less are not indexed. The ruleset controls
if and how the Scores class is used to index documents.
<br><br>
-->

<!--
<a name="msg10"></a>
<h2>Msg10</h2>
Msg14 calls Msg10 after updating all the Rdbs. Msg10 adds the links harvested
from the page. It does this using the <a href="#msg1">Msg1</a> class, but it
must also check to ensure that the links are not already in spiderdb by 
checking to see if they are in <a href="#urldb">Urldb</a>. 
Unless a link is <i>forced</i> then it
will not be added to spiderdb if it is already in Urldb.
Msg10 is also used by PageAddUrl to add submitted links or files that contain
a bunch of links to be added.
<br><br>
-->

<a name="gbfilter"></a>
<h2>Content Filtering</h2>
Gigablast supports multiple document types by saving the downloaded mime and 
content to a file, then calling the <i>gbfilter</i> program (gbfilter.cpp) 
which based on the content type in the mime will call pdftohtml, antiword,
pstotext, etc. and send the html/text content back to gb via stdout.
<br><br>

<a name="docids"></a>
<a name="msg22"></a>
<h2>DocIds</h2>
Every document indexed by Gigablast has a unique document id, called a docid. The docid is usually just the hash of the url it represents. Titledb::getProbableDocId() takes the url as a parameter and returns the probable docid for that url. The reason the docid is <i>probable</i> is that it may collide with the docid of an existing url and therefore will have to be changed. When we index a document, Msg14, the Msg class which is primarily responsible for indexing a document, calls Msg15::getOldDoc() to  retrieve the TitleRec (record in Titledb) for the supplied url (the url being indexed). Msg15 will then call Msg22::getTitleRec() to actually get the TitleRec for that url. If a TitleRec is not found for the given url then <b>Msg22.cpp</b> will sets its m_availDocId so Msg14 will know which available docid it can use for that url. 
<br><br>
Msg22 will actually load a list of TitleRecs from titledb corresponding to all the possible actual docids for the url. When the probable docid for a new url collides with the docid of an existing url, as evidenced by the TitleRec list, then Gigablast increments the new url's docid by one. Gigablast will only change the last six bits (bits 0-5) of a docid for purposes of collision resolution and it will wrap the docid if it tops out (see Msg22::gotUrlListWrapper). Titledb::getFirstProbableDocId() and Titledb::getLastProbableDocId() define the range of actual docids available given a probable docid by masking out or adding bits 0-5.  Bits 7 and up of the docid are used to determine which host in the network is responsible for storing the TitleRec for that docid, as illustrated in Titledb::getGroupId(). That is why collision resolution is limited to the lower six bits, because we don't want to, through collision resolution, resolve a TitleRec to another host, we want to keep it local. We also do not want the high bits of the docid being used for determining the group (shard) which stores that docId because when reading the termlist of linkers to a particular url, they are sorted by docId, which means we end up hitting one particular host in the network much harder than the rest when we attempt to extract the link text. If we have to increase these 6 bits in the future, then we may consider using some higher bits, like maybe bits 12 and up or something to avoid messing with the bits that control what hosts stores the TitleRec.
<br><br>
When Msg15 asks Msg22 for the TitleRec of a url being indexed, Msg22 will either return the TitleRec or, if the TitleRec does not exist for that url, it will set Msg22::m_availDocId to an available docid for that url to use. When looking up a TitleRec from a url, the first thing Msg22 does is define a startKey and endKey for a fetch of records from Urldb. Urldb consists of a bunch of dataless keys. Each of these keys consist of a docid, a hash extension and a file number.
<br><br>
If the file number in a Urldb record <b>is 255</b> then the corresponding docid is a <i>probable</i> docid (just a hash of the url as computed in Titledb::getProbableDocId()) and that the TitleRec is either in Titledb's RdbTree or that the TitleRec does not exist, but that url is slated for spidering and is contained in Spiderdb. This makes it easy to avoid adding duplicate urls to Spiderdb. Because different urls in Spiderdb may have the same probable docid, each Urldb record contains an 7-bit hash extension of the url used to reduce the chance of collision. The 38-bit docid hash plus this 7-bit extension gives an effective docid of 45 bits. Unfortunately, if a url has the same 45-bit hash as another different url it will not be permitted into Spiderdb and therefore will not be indexed. We have to rely on the extended hash thing because we cannot store the actual url in every Urldb record because keeping Urldb mostly in memory is very important for performance reasons.
<br><br>
If the file number in a Urldb record <b>is not 255</b>, then it refers to the particular Titledb file that contains the TitleRec for the corresponding docid. In this case, the docid in the Urldb record is the <i>actual</i> docid of the url, not the probable docid. In most cases the actual docid is the same as the probable docid, but when two different urls hash to the same probable docid, Msg22 will increment the actual docid of the url being added until it finds an unused actual docid.
<br><br>
The startKey and endKey for this particular Urldb request are constructed using the lowest and highest <i>actual</i> docids possible for the url. Because we only know the probable docid for that url, we have to assume that its lower six bits were changed in order to form its actual docid. Once we get back the list of records from Urldb we compute the extended hash of the url we are looking up and we scan through the list of records to see if any have the same extended hash. If a Urldb record in the list has the same extended hash, then we can extract the file number and consult the corresponding Titledb file to get the TitleRec. If the file number is 255 then we check for the TitleRec in Titledb's tree. If not in the tree, then url is probably slated for spidering but not yet in the index, so we conclude the TitleRec does not exist.
<br><br>
If we do not find a TitleRec for the url then we must return an available actual docid for the url, so the caller can index the url. In this case, in Msg22::gotUrlListWrapper() [line 292 in Msg22.cpp], we assume the probable docid is the actual docid. This assumption is a bug, because the probable docid may have been present in one of the Urldb records in the list, but the extended hash may not have matched the extended hash of the url. So this needs to be fixed. 
<br><br>
SIDE NOTE: To avoid having to lookup urls associated with each docid, a Query Reindex request will populate Spiderdb with docid-based records, rather than the typical url-based records. In this case, Msg15 can pass the exact docid to Msg22, so Msg22 does not have to worry about collisions and having to scan through a list of TitleRecs.
<br><br>


<a name="docidscaling">
<h2>Scaling to Many Docids</h2></a>

Currently, we are using 38 bit docids which allows for over 270 billion docids. Using the lower 6 bits of each docid for the chaning purposes as described above, means that there will be a problem if a probable docid is unable to be turned into an available actual docid by only changing the lower 6 bits of the probable docid because all the possible actual docids are occupied. These 6 bits correspond to 32 different values, therefore if we think of the range of possible actual docids being divided up into buckets, where each bucket is 32 consecutive docids, we might ask: what number of <i>full</i> buckets can we expect? Once a bucket is full we will have to turn away any url that hashes into that bucket. It turns out that when we have 128 billion documents the expected number of full buckets is only 29.80.
<br><br>
If we have 128 billion pages out of a possible 256 billion, each docid has a 50% probability of being used. Therefore, the probability of 32 consecutive used docids is (.5)^32 and the expected number of full buckets is (.5)^32 * 128 billion which is 29.80. If we have 16 billion pages out of the 256 billion the number of expected full buckets is a very tiny fraction. This is all assuming we have a uniformly distributed hash function.
<br><br>
The next scaling problem is that of urldb. Urldb enhances the probable docid with a 7-bit extension. The probability that a url's probable docid collides with another url's actual docid is fairly good in a 16 billion page index, it is 1/16. But then we multiply by 128 to get 1 in 2048, which is lousy. Therefore we should grow the extended bits by 16 so it is at least 1 in 134 million for a 16 billion page index which is ok because that means only about 100 urls will not be able to be indexed because of a collision in urldb. And with this 16-bit growth, we should still get decent compression for large indexes. That is, if we have 130 million pages per server, we'd have 1<<24 bits of the docid in the upper 6 bytes of the urldb key. That means we'd expect about 7 keys on average to share the same 6 bytes, (130,000,000/(1<<24)) = 7.74. That would still constitute about a 12% growth over current urldb sizes, though.

<a name="searchresultslayer"></a>
<h1>The Search Results Layer</h1>
This layer is responsible for taking a query url as input and returning
search results. Gigablast is capable of doing a few queries for every server
in the cluster. So if you double the number of servers you double the 
query throughput. 
<br><br>
Gigablast uses the <a href="#query">Query</a> class to break a query up into 
termIds. Each termId is a hash of a word or phrase in the query. Then the <a href="#indexlist">IndexList</a> for each termId is loaded and they are all 
intersected (by docId) in a hash table, and their scores are mapped and 
accumulated as well. Msg39 computes the top X docIds and then uses Msg38 to
get the site cluster hash and possibly the sample vector of each top docId. 
Clustered 
and duplicate results (docIds) are removed and if the total remaining is less 
than what
was requested, Msg39 redoes the intersection to try to get more docIds to
compensate. The final docIds are returned to Msg40 which uses Msg20 to fetch
a summary for each docId. Then PageResults display the final search results.

<a name="query"></a>
<h2>The Query Parser</h2>
The query syntax is described on <a href="http://www.gigablast.com/help.html">gigablast.com</a>. The Query class is responsible for converting a query into a list of termIds which are used to look up
<br><br>

<a name="raiding"></a>
<h2>Raiding TermList Intersections</h2>
An option for improving efficiency and parallelization is to "raid" term list disk reads and intersections.  There are multiple layers of "raiding" to distribute both disk reads and CPU use.  One level of disk raiding, called Indexdb Splitting, is implemented durring indexing.  Indexdb term lists are split between multiple hosts so that smaller parts of the full list may be read in parallel.  Another level of raiding splits the term list intersection between multiple "mercenary" hosts.  This can be done using Msg33 which replaces the functionality typically performed by Msg2 and some of that performed by Msg39.  An additional level of raiding may be performed by Msg33 to further split term list reads between twins.
<br><br>
Indexdb Splitting is enabled in the code by defining the SPLIT_INDEXDB #define.  The number splits to make is set with the INDEXDB_SPLIT #define.  For a single given term list, this will split which group (shard) the each term/docid entry is stored on based on the docid.  The seperate pieces of one term list will be retrieved and combined in one of two ways.  For general purpose access, a single Msg0 call may be made the same way it would normally be done without splitting.  Msg0 will then forward the request to all hosts storing a split piece of the desired list.  When each piece is collected, Msg0 will merge them together into one list.  Alternately, for queries, Msg33 may be used to take further advantage of the splitting (see below).
<br><br>
The primary function of Msg33 is to split term lists apart so that the intersection can be done in parallel.  Msg33 actually consists of multiple stages.  In the initial stage, "stage 0", the host processing Msg39 will create a Msg33 and allow it to retrieve the docids required.  This Msg33 will choose a number of hosts to act as "mercenary" machines, hosts which will recieve a piece of each term list and intersect those pieces together.  The number of mercenaries is either set as a parm or forced to the number of Indexdb Splits when using Indexdb Splitting.  Each mercenary is essentially responsible for a set of docids.
<br>
When not using Indexdb Splitting, the stage0 Msg33 will then call another Msg33 to each term list host, one for every term, executing "stage 1".  When using Indexdb Splitting, a Msg33 will be sent to each host containing a split piece for every term list.
<br>
The stage1 Msg33 on each term list host will read its specific term list.  When not using Indexdb Splitting, that term list will then be broken apart and sent with another Msg33 call to every mercenary machine which will perform intersection, executing "stage 2".  When using Indexdb Splitting, the term lists are effectively already aplit up and the piece read by stage1 will be sent as a whole to the one mercenary machine responisble for that set of docids.
<br>
The stage2 Msg33 on each mercenary machine will wait for all the requests from each stage1 host to be recieved, storing each in a global queue.  When all requests have been recieved, stage2 will intersect the term lists together, generating a partial set of final docids.  These final docids will then be sent with another Msg33 back to the original host (the one Msg39 is being processed on), executing "stage 3".
<br>
Like stage2, the stage3 Msg33 (also the stage0 Msg33) waits for all sets of docids to be recieved from each mercenary.  Once all have been recieved, stage3 will merge them together and create a true final set of docids to be used by Msg39.  Msg39 is allowed to continue before replies are sent back down the chain Msg33s to complete the entire process.
<br>
The entire Msg33 chain may be called multiple times (preserving the same stage0/3 and stage2 Msg33s) for each tier that is required by the Query.  Replies are not sent and the entire process in not cleaned up until the last tier has finished.
<br><br>
An additional ability of Msg33 is to further split the term list reads up amongst twins durring stage1.  Each twin will read a seperate half of the desired term list and set that half to the mercenaries, where all pieces will eventually be collected.
<br><br>

<a name="spellchecker"></a>
<h2>The Spell Checker</h2>
Spell checking is done by the Speller class. At startup the Speller class, the global g_speller, loads in a set of files, called dictionary files. These files are contained in the 'dict' subdirectory in the working directory of the Gigablast process. Each letter of the alphabet, and each digit, has its own dictionary file which exclusively contains the most popular words and phrases that beging with that particular letter (or digit). Each of these files contain one word or phrase per line, in addition to a score, which preceeds each word or phrase. This score is representative of how popular that word or phrase is.
<br><br>
Using 'gb gendicts' on the command line, you can tell Gigablast to generate these dictionary files from the titledb files. The entry routine for this is Speller::generateDicts(numWordsToDump). It will scan through titledb getting each titleRec and storing the words (parsed out from Xml.cpp and Words.cpp classes) and phrases it find from each titleRec into several temporary dictionary files. A word that starts with the letter 'a', for instance, will be stored in a different temporary dictionary file than a word that starts with the letter 'b'. Gigablast will stop scanning titleRecs once it has dumped out numWordsToDump words.
<br><br>
After storing numWordsToDump words into the temporary dictionary files, Gigablast sorts each file by making a system call to 'sort'. Then it converts each temporary dictionary file into another temporary file by scoring each word. Since each temporary dictionary file is sorted, scoring each word is simple. The score is just the number of times a particular word or phrase occurred throughout the titledb scan. Lastly, that second temporary file is sorted by score to get the actual dictionary file. Gigablast will throw away words or phrases with a score less than MIN_DOCS, currently #define'd to 3.
<br><br>
At startup, Gigablast loads all of the words and phrases from all of the dictionary files. It finds the highest score and normalizes all words and phrases by that score so that the normalized scores range from 1 to 10000, where 10000 is the most popular word or phrase. Furthermore, Gigablast loads a file called 'words', also contained in the 'dict' subdirectory, which is more or less a copy of /usr/share/dict/words. A lot of times during a titledb scan Gigablast will not pick up all the words that a dictionary has, so Gigablast will augment each dict file with the words from this 'words' files. It is a convenient way of adding any words, that begin with any letter, to Gigablast's spell checker.
<br><br>
Next, for each letter <i>x</i>, Gigablast computes a linked list for every pair of letters that start with the letter <i>x</i>. So, when <i>x</i> is <b>c</b> the linked list for the letters 'a' and 't', for example, would contain pointers to the words "cat", "carat" and "crate". So when it comes to spell checking you can fetch such a linked list for each pair of adjacent letters for the word in question, and intersect those lists to get spelling recommendations. But before doing that Gigablast also hashes each word from the dictionary files into a hashtable (Speller::makeHashTable()), so if the word in questions matches a word in the hashtable then no recommendation is computed.
<br><br>
As a memory saving procedure, which may now be somewhat unnecessary, Gigablast converts each letter in every word to a "dictionary character" using the to_dict_char() function. There are currently 40 (see #define for NUM_CHARS) dictionary characters, essentially just a-z and 0-9 plus a few punctuation marks (see Speller.h). This normalization procedure means that Gigablast can deal with less possible letter pairs and save some memory. This will present problems when trying to spell check Unicode characters, of course, and really, the whole letter pair thing may not be that applicable to Unicode, but it should still word in utf-8 at least, although spelling recommendations might be a little strange sometimes.
<br><br>
Besides computing spelling recommendations, dictionary files files are used to quickly measure a word's popularity. Before you can get the popularity of a word or phrase, unfortunately, it is currently converted into dictionary characters before it is hashed. This process is used extensively by the Gigabits generation code. It is essential that we know the popularity/score of a word or phrase. When getting the popularity of a Unicode word or phrase, converting it to dictionary characters may not be the best thing to do. So, all-in-all, if we can get rid of the dictionary character conversion requirements, i think getting the score of a Unicode word will work much better. 
<br><br>
Increasing NUM_CHARS to 256 may be a good idea, but there is long Speller::m_table[NUM_CHARS][NUM_CHARS][NUM_CHARS] which will jump from 256k to 67MB if we raise NUM_CHARS from 40 to 256. The first component in m_table is the letter that the possible misspelled word starts with, and the second and third indices are letter pairs in the word. (m_table is how we map a particular letter pair to a linked list of words that have that adjacent letter pair.) This means that all spelling recommendations for a word will start with the same letter as that word. It was done to speed things up and is definitely a bad short cut to take. But, since Gigablast computes the "edit distance" between the word in question and every word in the linked list, making the linked list about 1/40th the size really speeds up the computation.
<br><br>
I'm not too concerned with spell checking Unicode words right now, but I would like to have Unicode Gigabits. So if we could hash the words from the dictionary files without converting them to "dictionary characters" but just converting them to "lower case" I think we could handle Unicode words as far as getting their popularities is concerned. We could reserve dictionary characters for computing spelling recommendations only. Any ideas?

<a name="collections"></a>
<h2>Collections</h2>
Gigablast can support multiple collections. Each collection is essentially
a sub-index. You can create a collection, index urls into it, and just search
those urls. Each collection also has its own set of configurable parameters 
specified in the CollectionRec class. Collectiondb contains the array of
CollectionRecs and is used to map a collection name to a CollectionRec.
<br><br>
Currently, Gigablast uses just one Indexdb (Titledb, etc.) to hold data for 
all of the searchable collections. When constructing the key of a record to 
be added to the Rdb of a particular collection, the collection name itself will
be used, often, by just hashing it into the current key. In this manner, the 
probability of intercollection key collisions are made highly unlikely.
<br><br>
A defect of this model is that deleting a collection in its entirety
is not easy since its records are intermixed with records from other 
collections in Indexdb, Titledb, Spiderdb and Checksumdb. Therefore,
we are moving away from this model and creating a different directory for each
collection and storing that collection's records just in its directory.
This new model requires that the RdbTree class be modified to hold the 
collection number of each record. Also, RdbDump must be modified to dump each 
record into
the file in the proper directory, as determined by the collection. We can still
just use one instance of Indexdb, Titledb, etc., but we should add an extra
dimension to the Rdb class's "BigFile *m_files[];" array for the extra 
collections we have. When performing an kind of operation, the Rdb class should
select the appopriate files based on the supplied collection number. When a 
collection is deleted we must also remember to remove its records from the
RdbTree, in addition to removing the directory for that collection. Once 
implemented, this new model will vastly increase the value of
the Gigablast search product and make people much happier.
<br><br>

<a name="parms"></a>
<h2>Parameters and Controls</h2>


The CollectionRec class houses all of the configuration parameters used to
customize how a particular <a href="#collections">collection</a> is managed, 
how its search results are
displayed and how it indexes documents. There is one instance of the 
CollectionRec class per collection. 
<br><br>
The Conf class
houses all of the configuration parameters for things that are 
collection-independent, like the maximum amount of memory the process can use, 
for instance.
<br><br>
 Each CollectionRec has a xml-based configuration file called 
"coll.conf" stored in the collections' subdirectory. The Conf class is 
instantiated globally as g_conf and is initialized from the xml-based file
named "gb.conf", as described in the <a href="./overview.html#config">
user-based overview</a>.
<br><br>
All of the configuration parameters in these two classes are describe in an
array call m_parms which is contained in the Parms class.
Each element in this array is a Parm class. Each element has the following 
members:
<ul>
<li>a cgi variable name for setting the parameter from a browser HTTP request, 
<li>a title and description, for displaying the parameter on a web-based admin 
page
<li>an xml name, for loading/saving the parameter from/to an xml config file, 
<li>a "cast" setting, which is 1 if the parameter's value change should be 
broadcast to all hosts in the network,
<li>the type of parameter, like boolean, float or string,
<li>the size of the parameter, like 4 bytes for a float, X for a string,
<li>the offset of the parameter in Conf or CollectionRec,
<li>the maximum number of elements, if an array, of that parameter,
<li>and many more. See Pages.h and Pages.cpp.
</ul>
The Parms class automates the display and control of all configuration 
parameters through unified mechanisms. This allows the easy addition and 
removal of parameters, makes it easy to read and save parameters to an 
xml-based config file, and makes it easy to set parameters from a browser 
HTTP request.
<br><br>

<a name="log"></a>
<h2>The Log System</h2>

Logging is done with a command like:
<pre>
log(LOG_DEBUG,"query: a query debug message #%li.",n);
</pre>
The first parameter to the log() subroutine is the <i>type</i> of log message.
These types are defined in Log.h.<br><br>
The second parameter is a format string. The first word in the format string 
is the <i>subtype</i> of the log message. The subtype must be preceeded by a 
colon and be a particular word as already used in the source code. Please do 
not make up your own. The subtypes (take from Log.h) are as follows:<br><br>
<table cellpadding=3 border=1>
<tr><td><b>Subtype</b></td><td><b>Description</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>addurls</td><td> related to adding urls</td></tr>
<tr><td>admin</td><td>   related to administrative things, sync file, collections</td></tr>
<tr><td>build</td><td>   related to indexing (high level)</td></tr>
<tr><td>conf</td><td>    configuration issues</td></tr>
<tr><td>disk</td><td>    disk reads and writes</td></tr>
<tr><td>dns</td><td>     dns networking</td></tr>
<tr><td>http</td><td>    http networking</td></tr>
<tr><td>loop</td><td>
<tr><td>net</td><td>     network later: multicast pingserver. sits atop udpserver.</td></tr>
<tr><td>query</td><td>   related to querying (high level)</td></tr>
<tr><td>rdb</td><td>     generic rdb things</td></tr>
<tr><td>spcache</td><td> related to determining what urls to spider next</td></tr>
<tr><td>speller</td><td> query spell checking</td></tr>
<tr><td>thread</td><td>  calling threads</td></tr>
<tr><td>topics</td><td>  related topics</td></tr>
<tr><td>udp</td><td>     udp networking</td></tr>
<tr><td>uni</td><td>     unicode parsing</td></tr>
</table>
<br>
These various types and subtypes can be toggled on and off in the Log control
page via the administrative web GUI. To force a message to be logged
despite the control setting, use logf().<br><br>

All log messages are currently logged to stderr but may use a rotating file
scheme in the future.

<h2>Changing Live Clusters</h2>
This is a brief overview of how to switch the live www.gigablast.com site from one cluster to another, what changes are required, and what things to keep in mind.  The cluster which is to become live will be refered to as the "new cluster" and the one which is to be replaced will be refered to as the "old cluster".
<br><br>
Diff the gb.conf and coll.conf(s) between the new cluster and old cluster to check for undesired differences.  If no real-time spidering will be done, the readOnlyMode option should be set to 1 in the new cluster's gb.conf.  Additionally, blaster the new cluster to check for potential bugs with a new version of gb.  Now leave the new cluster on and ready to serve queries.
<br><br>
On both the primary and secondary dns servers, edit /etc/bind/db.gigablast.com.  Comment out the "www","dir","gov","@", and any other hostnames currently pointing to the old cluster.  Replicate these lines (or uncomment old existing lines) and point them to the ip of the new cluster.  Kill and restart named using: "killall -9 named ; /etc/rc3.d/S15bind9 start".  If everything is working correctly, traffic will begin to shift over to the new cluster.  Both should be left running until the old cluster is no longer seeing any traffic.
<br><br>
Something to watch for is that port 80 on the new cluster is correctly mapped to port 8000.  Check in /etc/rcS.d/S99local near the bottom for the line:
<pre>
/sbin/iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT --to-destination 64.62.168.XX:8000
</pre> 
This command should be executed at startup to perform the mapping.
<br><br>
After waiting a couple of days, force the traffic that hard-coded the IP for gigablast.com to start using the new cluster by running the following commands as root on host #0 on the old cluster, for instance, this is for gf0 (64.62.168.3), if gf0 were host #0 of the old cluster, and gb1 (64.62.168.52) is host #0 of the new cluster:
<pre>
gf0:/a# echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward 
gf0:/a# /sbin/iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT --to 64.62.168.52:8000
gf0:/a# /sbin/iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -d 64.62.168.52 -p tcp --dport 8000 -j SNAT --to 64.62.168.3
</pre>

<h1>Fighting Spam</h1>
Spam is perhaps the leading issue in quality control. How do we remove undesirable and useless pages from the search results? Fighting spammers is like an endless cat and mouse game. Before we discuss any more, we must ask ourselves, <i>What is spam?</i> 
<br><br>
A spam page consists of a bunch of links and generated content.  The generated content uses various sources as the basis for the content generation.  These sources include other static web pages, search results pages, resources like dictionaries, dmoz, query logs, and databases from shopping sites like amazon, ebay, allposters or zappos. The exact sources of input used by the generating function is not always clear.
<!--
<br><br>
The ideal spam-fighting algorithm may be a deduping algorithm in combination with a nonsense detector. Zak, how can we write a global fuzzy deduper? This deduper could be used to reduce the quality, and therefore page quota, of individual IPs and domains. If a domain consists mostly of generated content its quality should be reduced in sitedb.
-->
<br><br>
To fight spam using a different approach, we have devised a quality-determination algorithm which uses a point-based system.  Our base measure of quality is based upon offsite factors, such as number of incoming links weighted by the quality of those incoming links.  The spam detector then looks at onsite factors such as the fingerprints of content entirely generated automatically, links to affiliate moneymaking sites, or irregular language model, and adds a negative quality proportional to the number of questionable practices the page engages in.  The total quality of a page is the sum of the link-adjusted quality and the negative spam quality.
<br><br>
Our attributes for spam detection have been gleaned from examining thousands of spam and non-spam documents.  The weights are adjustable, and have been manually tuned to provide good spam detection, while minimizing false positives.  The points for each attribute is multiplied by the number of times the attribute occured in the document.  The total points for each attribute are then added for a raw total of points.  The raw total is then multiplied by a force multiplier.  The force multiplier is calculated by .01 * the number of attributes had a non-zero number of points.  This provides a much heavier weight for pages which have many 'spammy' qualities, while reducing false positives for pages which have lots of points in a single category.  This produces a small integer which is capped at MaxQuality points and comprises the negative quality weight.  
<br><br>
<table width="100%" border="1" bgcolor=#999999><tr><td><b>Spam Scores</b></td><td><b>Points</b></td><td><b>Occurences</b></td><td><b>Total</b></td></tr><tr><td>url has - or _ or a digit in the domain</td><td>20</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>tld is info or biz</td><td>20</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>tld is gov,edu, or mil</td><td>-20</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>title has spammy words</td><td>20</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>page has img src to other domains</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>page contains spammy words</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>consecutive link text has the same word</td><td>10</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>links to amazon, allposters, or zappos</td><td>10</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>has 'affiliate' in the links</td><td>40</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>has an iframe to amazon</td><td>30</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>links to urls > 128 chars long</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>links have ?q= or &q=</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>page has google ads</td><td>15</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Raw Total</td><td></td><td></td><td>20</td><tr><td>Force Multiplier</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.020000</td><tr><td>Final Score</td><td></td><td></td><td>0</td></table>
<!-- Some of these algorithms determine the quality of a site or IP address, and some the individual page. The algorithms that operate on the site or IP address need to run in batch mode and will add entries to sitedb. The algorithms that score individual pages can be run right after the url is downloaded. This algorithm could be used in combination with the global fuzzy deduper to get even better results.

<br><br>
+30 If domain is very bushy. like an N-to-N graph.

<br><br>
<h2>Search engine results pages (SERPS)</h2>
Many pages indexed by search engines are themselves search engine pages.  This could be because of a misconfigured robots.txt which fails to tell search engines not to index their results pages, or they could be included by a php script by a search engine spammer because they will include keywords which are close in relevency to a query term.  In any case, they are useless content.  In order to detect these pages, we use a points system which looks for the structure of title - summary - url several times in a row, as well as things like next and prev links, and queries in the url.  These points are added together and normalized between 0 and 100 to give a likelihood that the page is a serp.

<!--INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR BACKUP SOLUTION
========================================================
WRITTEN BY: Matt Sabino 04/03/06
NOTE: The > is used to show a command prompt.
      Also, any user defined information in commands are shown through the 
      <user defined information> notation.


[Getting Started]
------------------

In order to install the backup solution, there must be some prerequisite installs.  Assuming we 
are running on a Debian linux kernel as root, these prerequisites can be gotten through 
'apt-get'.  We need the following packages:

	 =================================
	 = PACKAGE		VERSION	 =
	 =-------------------------------=
	 = ssh			 3.8.1p1 =
	 = gnupg		 1.4.2.2 =
	 = duplicity		 0.4.1   =
	 = backupninja		 0.9.3-4 =
	 =================================

First me must update our cache with the following command:
	> apt-get update
Now search for the appropriate package names:
	> apt-cache search <pkgName>
Assuming all package were found verify that the versions match or exceed the above list:
	> apt-cache showpkg <pkgName>
Assuming all is well, we shall begin installation.
	> apt-get install <pkgName>
Now that we have our programs installed, we need to configure them.

[SSH]
-----------------
To begin using a backup client across a network, we must have ssh working where no 
passwords/phrases are used.  Remember to press <Enter> when asked for a passphrase, as using a 
passphrase will cause confusion during backupninja configuration.  To do this we first generate 
a key for the source host (still in root):
	> ssh-keygen -t dsa
Now that we have our keys stored under the /root/.ssh, we need to supply the public key to our 
destination host:
	> ssh-copy-id -i /root/.ssh/id_dsa.pub <destUser>@<destHost>
Now attempt to ssh into the destination host machine:
	> ssh <destUser>@<destHost>
If you were able to ssh without the use of a password/phrase successfully, we may now go onto 
the next step.  If you had problems, make sure your host is entered into your /etc/hosts file 
and that all spellings were correct.  


[GPG]
-----------------
Without GPG keys in place, duplicity will fail quite violently when encryption is attempted.  
Therefore we shall begin by generating the key for the root at the source host:
	> gpg --gen-key
Follow the prompts and enter for a 'DSA and ElGamal' with 2048 keysize.  Now for practical 
purposes, such as losing the gpg files for bad drives, virii, corruption, etc, we are going to 
export both the public and private key so that we may print them out or move them to a secure 
location:
        > gpg --armor --export root > public_key.gpg.asc
	> gpg --armor --export-secret-subkeys root > secret_key.gpg.asc

GPG is now in place and can be used to encrypt our backup files and send them across the 
network.  We will need to come back to GPG and obtain the source host's root public key if we 
wish to encrypt any duplicity actions.  This can be done by executing:       
        > gpg --list-keys
	/root/.gnupg/pubring.gpg
	------------------------
	pub  1024D/B036117C 2006-03-29 [expires: 2007-03-29]
	uid		    Administrator (GPG for Backup) <root@<srcHost>.com>
	sub  1024g/5D2059A1 2006-03-29 [expires: 2007-03-29]
Now we find that the public key is "B036117C" for the root on the source host.  We will hold 
on to that string of hex characters, so that we can setup backupninja.


[duplicity]
-----------------
At this time, I believe duplicity is fully configurable through backupninja and therefore does 
not need any configuration to operate properly.


[backupninja]
-----------------
In order to configure backupninja, there are 2 types of config files, global and local.  The 
global configuration file should reside at /etc/backupninja.conf.  The global file doesn't have 
too many settings to manipulate and is commented which should make it fairly straight forward.  
However, a sample configuration is supplied below:
	 #
	 #                          |\_
	 # B A C K U P N I N J A   /()/
	 #                         `\|
	 # main configuration file
	 #
	 
	 # how verbose to make the logs
	 # 5 -- Debugging messages     (and below)
	 # 4 -- Informational messages (and below)
	 # 3 -- Warnings               (and below)
	 # 2 -- Errors                 (and below)
	 # 1 -- Fatal errors           (only)
	 loglevel = 5
	 # send a summary of the backup status to
	 # this email address:
	 reportemail = msabino@gigablast.com
	 
	 # if set to 'yes', a report email will be generated
	 # even if all modules reported success. (default = yes)
	 reportsuccess = yes
	 
	 # if set to 'yes', a report email will be generated
	 # even if there was no error. (default = yes)
	 reportwarning = yes
	 
	 #######################################################
	 # for most installations, the defaults below are good #
	 #######################################################
	 
	 # where to log:
	 logfile = /var/log/backupninja.log
	 
	 # directory where all the backup configuration files live
	 configdirectory = /etc/backup.d
	 
	 # where backupninja helper scripts are found
	 scriptdirectory = /usr/share/backupninja
	 
	 # where backupninja libs are found
	 libdirectory = /usr/lib/backupninja
	 
	 # whether to use colors in the log file
	 usecolors = yes
	 
	 # default value for 'when'
	 when = everyday at 01:00
	 
	 # if running vservers, set to yes
	 vservers = no

	 # programs paths
	 # SLAPCAT=/usr/sbin/slapcat
	 # LDAPSEARCH=/usr/bin/ldapsearch
	 # RDIFFBACKUP=/usr/bin/rdiff-backup
	 # MYSQL=/usr/bin/mysql
	 # MYSQLHOTCOPY=/usr/bin/mysqlhotcopy
	 # MYSQLDUMP=/usr/bin/mysqldump
	 # PGSQLDUMP=/usr/bin/pg_dump
	 # PGSQLDUMPALL=/usr/bin/pg_dumpall
	 # GZIP=/bin/gzip
	 # RSYNC=/usr/bin/rsync
	 # VSERVERINFO=/usr/sbin/vserver-info
	 # VSERVER=/usr/sbin/vserver
Scheduling can be changed to any time that can be expressed under these examples (taken from 
backupninja's website):
	   when = sundays at 02:00
	   when = 30th at 22
	   when = 30 at 22:00
	   when = everyday at 01 <-- the default
	   when = Tuesday at 05:00
	   when = hourly
For additional information please refer to:  http://dev.riseup.net/backupninja/configuration/

Backupninja is also setup to send emails to the administrator upon problems arising with backup.
For backupninja to be able to email, postfix needs to be installed and configured.  There is 
another document that should be referenced in regards to this.

Local configuration files are used to specify saving which files, emails, databases, etc.  These
files are located at /etc/backup.d and are not provided for you.  Symbolic links to 
/etc/backup.d does not work for backupninja configuration files.  Out of the box, backupninja 
supports the following configuration files:
      .dup	    handler for backing up with duplicity
      .ldap	    handler for backing up ldap databases
      .maildir	    handler to incrementally backup maildirs
      .mysql	    handler for backing up mysql databases
      .pgsql	    handler for backing up PostgreSQL databases
      .rdiff	    handler for keeping remote, incremental copies of specified 
		    portions of the file system
      .sh	    run the configuration file as a shell script
      .svn	    handler to backup subversion repositories
      .sys	    handler for recording miscallaneous and useful system and hardware data
Additional configuration files may be created to handle different types of files by creating 
bash scripts in the /usr/share/backupninja directory.  For more details, refer to:  
http://dev.riseup.net/backupninja/handlers/

If working with the configuration files feels intimidating, have no fear, a gui utility has been
made.  The utility is called ninjahelper and provideds a graphical interface that the user 
answers questions to build their backup actions.

Continuing with the configuration files, there is not too much documentation other than what is 
provided in the sample scripts at http://dev.riseup.net/backupninja/handlers/.  All of the 
scripts have been copied into the examplebk directory with their proper extensions for the 
readers review.

Some minor details regarding the configuration files:
     -files MUST be owned, readable and writable ONLY by root
     -each file MAY have a different 'when' statement, which takes precedence over the 
      global 'when'
     -files are executed in alphabetical order
     -duplicity requires user to input public GPG key (even though script says it shouldnt)
      SEE SECTION [GPG] above for further information
     -note what time your server is running at, UTC != MST and set your when accordingly
     -currently quickbooks is giving backupninja permission fits


[Restoring Backup]
-------------------
For restoration from backup, duplicity must be used.  There isn't too much to know other than 
how your ssh is handled and where you want your backup to be restored to.
     > duplicity --scp-command 'scp -i /root/.ssh/<id_dsa private file>' 
       --ssh-command 'ssh -i /root/.ssh/<id_dsa private file>' 
       scp://<backupUser>@<backupHost>//<backupDir> <restoreDir>
Example, currently the backup system on voyager is setup, so a proper resstore command might
look like this:
     > duplicity --scp-command 'scp -i /root/.ssh/id_dsa_duplicity' 
       --ssh-command 'ssh -i /root/.ssh/id_dsa_duplicity' 
       scp://backupuser@voyager2//sata/backup /sata/backup/duplicity_test
