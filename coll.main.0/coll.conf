# Before downloading the contents of a URL, Gigablast first chains down this
# list of expressions</a>, starting with expression #0.  The first expression
# it matches is the ONE AND ONLY matching row for that url. It then uses the
# respider frequency, spider priority, etc. on the MATCHING ROW when spidering
# that URL. If you specify the <i>expression</i> as <i><b>default</b></i> then
# that MATCHES ALL URLs. URLs with high spider priorities take spidering
# precedence over URLs with lower spider priorities. The respider frequency
# dictates how often a URL will be respidered. See the help table below for
# examples of all the supported expressions. Use the <i>&&</i> operator to
# string multiple expressions together in the same expression text box. A
# <i>spider priority</i> of <i>FILTERED</i> or <i>BANNED</i> will cause the
# URL to not be spidered, or if it has already been indexed, it will be
# deleted when it is respidered.<br><br>
